However, early structure of Joseon followed former organ to make dominance of judicial power, which was resulted to take over the work of judicial police only.
Working with Saheonbu, the organ dealt with the lese majesty or legal execution. Generally, the responsibility covers the crimes of bureaucrats, foreigners or treason or the incidents seriously against the Confucianism. It also worked as the special court in emergency case.
The system of the organ was changed several times depending on the code in the current time. In 1414, the institution came to possess full independence. Basically, 4 subjects held the concurrent position. According to official code of Gyeongguk daejeon, about 200 officials coped with the judicial matters.
