Reception
Critical response
The film received mixed reviews. Praise was given to the acting performances (particularly by Cho Seung-woo, Baek Yoon-sik, and Ji Sung), and cinematography. Most criticisms centered on how the film failed to become a gripping political period-drama despite its solid cast, and some weak performances (particularly by Ji Sung and Lee Won-geun).Yoon Min-sik from The Korea Herald wrote, "Director Park does a passable job of keeping up the suspense with intriguing characters and depiction of the peril at hand, although this is not an immensely difficult task with the abundance of quality actors. Cho is good as usual, and Baekâ€™s steady tone and solemn look reek of charisma. However, the film relies too much on luck, guesswork and brute force to appeal as a political drama."Woo Jae-yeon from Yonhap News Agency wrote, "Despite the compelling story peppered with twists and stellar performances by Cho Seung-woo, Ji Sung and Baek Yoon-sik, one might leave the theater, feeling the business is unsolved and more stories are left to be told...[however] the filming locations, boosted by the excellent work of the cinematography, is quite breathtaking and fascinating."
