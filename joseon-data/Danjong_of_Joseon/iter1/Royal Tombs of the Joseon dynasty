The Tombs of the Joseon dynasty refers to the 40 tombs of members of the House of Yi, which ruled Korea (at the time known as Joseon, and later as the Korean Empire) between 1392–1910. These tombs are scattered over 18 locations across the Korean Peninsula. They were built to honor and respect the ancestors and their achievements, and assert their royal authority. The tombs have been registered as an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009. Two other Joseon tombs, located in Kaesong, North Korea, were proposed but not submitted.

Structure of the tombs
The royal tombs can be divided into three main sections:

The part around Jeongjagak
It is the meeting point between the dead and the living. The area around Hongsalmun gate is the space for the living.

The area just past the gate
This is the space between the earthly and the holy. This is the area where the spirits of the kings and queens meet their earthly worshippers. This area also contains the Jeongjagak shrine, the Subokbang, and the Suragan buildings.

The sacred ground of the grave mounds
This area also includes the wall, and the other stone structures.

Other structures
Other structures include:
Gokjang – these are the five sides of walls around the grave mound that protects the sacred area.
Seokho – the tiger deity which serves as the guardian of the Bongbun.
Seogyang – a sheep statue which fends off the evil spirits from earth and prays for the souls of the departed.
Mangjuseok – this is a pair of stone pillars erected on both sides of the mound.
Bongbun – this is where the body of the king or queen lies. It is also called Neungchim or Neungsang.
Nanganseok – it is the hedge-like stone which protects the Byeongpungseok.
Honnyuseok – a rectangular stone erected in front of the mound which is believed to invite the soul to come out and play.
Muninseok – statues of scholars placed on the left and right sides of the Jangmyeongdeung lantern.
Jangmyeongdeung – a lantern which comforts and prays blessing over the soul.
Seongma – a horse statue.
Muinseok – statue of a soldier said to be guarding the king and is placed below the Muninseok.
Yegam – it is located on the left-side corner behind the Jeongjagak and is used for burning the written prayers after a burial service.
Bigak – a building which has a stone monument where the names of the king and the queen are written at the front, while at the back was written the list of the king's accomplishments.
Jeongjagak – this is where memorial services are held.
Chamdo – these are two stone-covered paths that leads to the Jeongjagak. The higher path is called Sindo (The Path of the Gods), while the lower path is called Eodo (The Path Of the King). Only the Eodo path can be used by visitors in accordance to Korean custom.
Suragan – this is where the food for the memorial services are brought and prepared.
Subokbang – this is the living quarter of the officer guarding the tomb.
Baewi – this is where the king and memorial service officials knelt in honor of the deceased king. It is also called Panwi or Eobaseok.
Hongsalmun – this is the gate with two red cylindrical pillars.
Byeongpungseok – it is the stone which was placed underneath and around to protect the Bongbun.

Tombs
The tombs are classified into two types. The kings and queens and those posthumously granted the title of king or queen, were interred in neung-type tombs. Crown princes and their wives were interred in won-type tombs.
Other members of the royal family were interred in myo-type tombs.
The royal tombs are scattered over 18 locations, with many of them located as far as 40 kilometers from Seoul. For example, Jangneung is in Yeongwol, Gangwon Province, while Yeongneung is in Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province. Tombs were made for individuals as well as family groups. There are 40 neung-type and 13 won-type tombs, thus creating a total of 53 royal tombs.
Joseon-era royal tombs followed the guidelines outlined in Chinese Confucian texts, such as the Book of Rites (Li Ji) and the Rites of Zhou (Zhou Li). Many factors went into consideration when deciding the location of a tomb, such as the distance from Hanseong (present-day Seoul), the distance in relation to other royal tombs, the accessibility of the location, and Korean traditions of pungsu (geomancy). The tomb construction also took into account traditional burial rituals of Korea and the natural environment.
There now follows a list (in alphabetical order) of the individual (or clusters of) tombs. There are two more royal tombs from the Joseon Dynasty in Kaesong, North Korea, namely Jeneung (제릉) (the tomb of Queen Sinui, first wife of King Taejo) and Huneung (후릉) (the tombs of King Jeongjong and Queen Jeongan).

Dongguneung Cluster (동구릉)
37°37′11″N 127°07′53″E
This cluster is the best sample of group tombs from the Joseon era and represents the evolution of tomb architecture over a period of five hundred years. Seven kings and ten queens are interred in nine neung-type tombs. The most notable in this group is Geonwonneung (건원릉) for King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon dynasty. The other tombs in the cluster are Gyeongneung (경릉) (King Heonjeong and his two wives, Queen Hyohyeon and Queen Hyojeong), Hyeneung (혜릉) (Queen Danui, first wife of King Gyeongjong), Hwineung (휘릉) (Queen Jangnyeol, second wife of King Injo), Mongneung (목릉) (King Seonjo and his two wives, Queen Uiin and Queen Inmok), Sungneung (숭릉) (King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong), Suneung (수릉) (Crown Prince Hyomyeong, who was posthumously honored as King Munjo, and Queen Sinjeong), Wonneung (원릉) (King Yeongjo and his second wife, Queen Jeongsun) and Myeongbinmyo (명빈묘) (Royal Noble Consort Myeong of the Andong Kim clan, a concubine of King Taejong). The cluster is situated on the west bank of the Wangsukcheon Stream in the city of Guri, Gyeonggi Province.

Gwangneung (광릉)
37°45′08″N 127°10′38″E
Gwangneung is a pair of tombs in the city of Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province. The tombs, arranged in a V shape, contain the remains of King Sejo and his wife, Queen Jeonghui. They were built in 1468 and 1483 respectively. Gwangneung is important because changes taking place in the architecture of royal tombs are evident in its construction. Screening rocks were not installed at this tomb. Instead of an outer coffin stone, quicklime was used. Another break from tradition was that the reverential access was not built. Finally, only one T-shaped ritual shrine was built for both burial mounds. This change in tomb architecture came from the last wishes of the king and reflects a new frugal style that influenced later royal tomb construction.
