Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Sangsan Kim clan (Hangul: 숙의 김씨, Hanja: 淑儀 金氏; 1440 - 1525) was a Joseon royal consort of Danjong of Joseon.

Life
Lady Kim was born into the Sangsan Kim clan in 1440 as the daughter of Kim Sa-woo and Lady Yi of the Gwangju Yi clan.In 1454, she entered Changdeok Palace along with Lady Song of the Yeosan Song clan, Song Hyeon-Su's daughter, and Lady Kwon of the Andong Kwon clan, Kwon Wan's daughter, for the consort process. It was then decided that Lady Song, the future Queen Jeongsun, would become the King's Queen Consort, and Lady Kwon and Lady Kim would become concubines.Afterwards, she lived in the house of Prince Milseong, the illegitimate son of King Sejong, and entered the palace together on January 24 of the lunar calendar when Queen Jeongsun was appointed. At some point, Suk-ui Kim fell ill after entering the palace, and Danjong moved her residence to the residence of his uncle, Grand Prince Suyang.
Grand Prince Suyang eventually led a coup de’tat against his nephew, and took over the throne. Danjong later died in 1457 by order of execution.
Even after King Danjong's abdication, Lady Kim and her father were in a better condition than Queen Jeongsun and her father.
Lady Kim's father, Kim Sa-woo, continued to hold government posts and was in charge of the military. Accordingly, several ministers wanted to impeach Kim Sa-woo, but King Sejo did not permit the impeachment because Kim Sa-woo was a public servant. Afterwards, Kim Sa-woo, unlike Song Hyeon-su and Kwon Wan, who were executed while trying to restore King Danjong, served various government posts and died in 1464 during the 10th year of King Sejo.
On the other hand, Lady Kim seemed to have lived in Seoul all the way after the death of King Danjong. In 1519, the 14th year of King Jungjong, on January 26 of the lunar calendar, she survived over 80 years of age and began to pay tribute to the country. At that time, using the example of the fact that the Lady Kim paid her taxes for every year while she was alive in Yejo, he inquired about her wealth. She did not have any wealth because she was a concubine whose husband died.
On the other hand, because Lady Kim did not resuscitate and did not have any children with the deceased king, she was permitted to adopt a male relative from her maternal clan, Yi Yak-bing of the Gwangju Yi clan. Lady Kim later died in 1525 at the age of 85, and is buried in Chungju, Chungcheong Province.
