Jo Man-yeong (Korean: 조만영; Hanja: 趙萬永; 1776 — 1846) was a Korean politician and court minister of the Joseon Dynasty. He was the leader of the Pungyang Jo clan. The clan rose to prominence, pushing out the Andong Kim clan that had wielded power since the King Sunjo regime. However, with the death of Jo Man-yeong in 1846, control of the kingdom once again fell into the hands of the Andong Kim clan. He was the father of Queen Sinjeong and the maternal grandfather of Heonjong of Joseon. As his daughter posthumously became Queen consort, Jo was then honoured as Internal Prince Pungeun (풍은부원군, 豊恩府院君).
