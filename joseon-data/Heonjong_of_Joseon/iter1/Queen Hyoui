Queen Hyoui (Hangul: 효의왕후, Hanja: 孝懿王后; 5 January 1754 – 10 April 1821), of the Cheongpung Kim clan (Hangul: 청풍김씨, Hanja: 淸風金氏), was the wife and queen consort of King Jeongjo of Joseon. In 1899, Emperor Gojong posthumously gave her the name of Hyoui, the Kind Empress (효의선황후, 孝懿宣皇后).

Biography
The future Queen Hyoui was born on 5 January 1754 in the twenty-ninth year of King Yeongjo's reign. She was the daughter of Kim Si-muk (Hangul: 김시묵, Hanja: 金時默) and his wife Lady Hong of the Namyang Hong clan (Hangul: 남양 홍씨, Hanja: 南陽 洪氏).  
She married Yi San, then known as the Crown Prince's son, in 1762 at the age of 9, on the tenth day of the second lunar month in the thirty-eighth year of King Yeongjo's reign. It was said that the reason why Lady Kim became the wife of the young crown prince was because she came from the Cheongpung Kim clan; the clan of Queen Myeongseong who was her great-great-grand aunt.
Her younger cousin, Lady Kim, later married a younger brother of Lady Hyegyeong, which then gave her clan more royal connections.
She became Queen Consort upon her husband's accession to the throne in 1776.
Queen Hyoui did not bear King Jeongjo any children, but she adopted the sons of two of her husband's concubines, Royal Noble Consort Ui and Royal Noble Consort Su, as her own. The son of Royal Noble Consort Ui died young, but the son of Royal Noble Consort Su would eventually succeed King Jeongjo on the throne as King Sunjo.
Queen Hyoui outlived her husband, who died in 1800, by 21 years. She died at Jagyeong Hall, Changgyeong Palace, Hanseong, on the ninth day of the third month in the twenty-first year of King Sunjo's reign.
