Biography
Early life
The future Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong was born into the Hadong Jeong clan on 23 September 1522 as the daughter of Jeong Se-Ho, and his wife, Lady Yi of the Gwangju Yi clan.
Her father, Jeong Se-Ho was the son of Jeong Sang-Jo and Lady Ahn of the Juksan Ahn clan; making him the grandson and Lady Jeong a great-granddaughter of Jeong In-ji. Her paternal grandmother, Lady Ahn, was the granddaughter of Princess Jeongui; who was the second daughter of Queen Soheon and King Sejong. Thus making her the maternal great-great-granddaughter through her grandmother.
Meanwhile, her mother was the daughter of Yi Se-geol and Lady Jeon of the Jeongseon Jeon clan. Lady Jeong had 2 older brothers and a younger brother. Her paternal cousin, Lady Jeong of the Hadong Jeong clan, eventually became the grandmother of Queen Yu, the wife of King Gwanghaegun.

Marriage and later life
She later married Yi Cho when he was still Prince Deokheung (덕흥군, 德興君) and was honoured as Princess Consort Hadong (하동군부인, 河東郡夫人). Her father was then honored as Duke Hyogan, Internal Prince Hadong (효간공 하동부원군).
During her marriage, she gave birth to a son in 1545, a second son in 1546, a daughter in 1548, and a third son in 1552.
On 24 June 1567, during King Myeongjong’s 22nd year of reign, she died at 46 years old. Her tomb is located near from her husband's tomb.

Seonjo's ascension to the throne
Two months after her death, her third son, Yi Yeon, Prince Haseong succeeded Myeongjong who died without a royal heir. Thus becoming Myeongjong's adopted son when the prince ascended the throne as the 14th king of Joseon. Her husband couldn’t be King (왕, 王) because of his low background, so the throne was immediately passed down to his legitimate son. On 1 November 1569, as the Princess Consort was the biological parent of the reigning King, she was granted the royal title of Princess Consort Hadong (하동부부인, 河東府夫人) at first, but was later changed to Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong (하동부대부인, 河東府大夫人).
