Career
Jung Jun-ho started his acting career at 1995. He never thought of entering the entertainment industry and becoming an actor.

He began to realize his talent - acting. He joined MBC station training class at 1995. Although he worked with many famous stars like Lee Young-ae during the first few years of his acting career, the movies and series he made in the first few years did not lend him much limelight; he remained in obscurity.
