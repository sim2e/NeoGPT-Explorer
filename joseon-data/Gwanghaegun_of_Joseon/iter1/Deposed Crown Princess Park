Biography
On 2 August 1611 (3rd year reign of Gwanghaegun of Joseon, her future father in-law), the 13-year-old Lady Park was chosen as the Crown Princess Consort (왕세자빈, 王世子嬪) and then married with Gwanghaegun's son, Crown Prince Yi Ji. Later, in August 1614, she gave birth to their first daughter but died sometime after in the winter.Meanwhile, on 13 March 1623, Park was deposed from her position along with her in-law's and got exiled to Ganghwa Island. Her family was exiled too and some of them were beheaded as execution. 
While in exile, the deposed couple fasted or tried to commit suicide by hanging themselves, but failed. In the end, about two months later in April (May of the lunar calendar), Yi Ji was digging a tunnel to escape. When his wife and him tried to escape the island, they were caught by the royal soldiers. The deposed crown princess committed suicide in June 1623 (lunar calendar May) the third day after her husband was arrested. She was 26 years old. Then on 22 July, a month after his late wife’s death (in Lunar calendar was 25 June), her husband died from hunger.
Park didn't receive a posthumous name because she was deposed from her position.
