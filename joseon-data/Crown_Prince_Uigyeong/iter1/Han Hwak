Han Hwak (Hangul: 한확, Hanja: 韓確); 1400 – 1456), nicknamed Ganyijae (간이재), was a politician and a diplomat during the Joseon period of Korea. He served as Left State Councillor. Han Hwak is mostly known by his second daughter, the Queen Insu. She married the son of Prince Suyang (who was a son of King Sejong). Some years later, Suyang became King Sejo, the seventh King of the Joseon Dynasty, and his son became Crown Prince Uigyeong. The honorary title Queen Insu was granted when one of the children of Insu and Uigyeong became the King Seongjong of Joseon. His eldest daughter Princess Consort Jeongseon, was the wife of Prince Gyeyang (a son of Sejong the Great by a concubine).
