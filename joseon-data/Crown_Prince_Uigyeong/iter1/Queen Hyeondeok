Queen Hyeondeok (Hangul: 현덕왕후 권씨, Hanja: 顯德王后 權氏; 17 April 1418 – 10 August 1441), of the Andong Gwon clan, was the primary consort of Crown Prince Yi Hyang. She died giving birth to the future Danjong of Joseon and was posthumously honoured as Queen Hyeondeok (현덕왕후) in 1450, later demoted by Sejo of Joseon after he deposed her son, then restored by Jungjong of Joseon.

Biography
Lady Gwon was born on 17 April 1418 into the Andong Gwon clan to Gwon Jeon and his wife, Choi Ah-Ji, Lady Choi of the Haeju Choi clan. She had five younger siblings.
At the age of 12-13, Lady Gwon entered the palace in 1431 alongside two other girls, Lady Jeong of the Dongrae Jeong clan and Lady Hong of the Namyang Hong clan. All were granted Seunghwi; the 4th junior rank of the crown prince’s concubine (Hangul: 승휘). She gave birth to a daughter in 1433, but she died before she reached the age of one.In 1435, Consort Gwon became pregnant, which drew the jealously of Crown Princess Sun, who had no children and feared that she would be removed in favor of Gwon. She later gave birth to Princess Gyeonghye in 1436. After Crown Princess Sun was banished for sleeping with her maid, Royal Consort Seunghwi was promoted to Yangwon (양원), the 3rd junior rank of concubine.
Soon after though, officials suggested that Kwon be made the next crown princess, as she already had a child, was older than Lady Hong, and her father's government position was high. She was made Crown Princess Gwon late in 1437.On 9 August 1441, Crown Princess Gwon gave birth to a son named Yi Hong-wi, which was much celebrated, as he was the crown prince's only son. However, Gwon did not recover from the birth and died a day later. She was granted the posthumous title of Crown Princess Consort Hyeondeok (Hangul: 현덕빈, Hanja: 顯德嬪) and buried at Soreung (Hanja: 昭陵) in Ansan, Gyeonggi. It was said that her death had deeply saddened her husband and father-in-law, as well as those who lived and worked in the palace.
Sejong stated that the crown princess had graceful virtues and was admirable, compassionate, and dignified.

Posthumous status
When Munjong of Joseon ascended the throne, he granted his wife the title of Queen Hyeondeok. Her son later bestowed a full posthumous name during his reign.In 1457, several years after her brother-in-law Sejo of Joseon had deposed her son as king, Queen Hyeondeok's brother and his mother-in-law were found guilty of treason and executed. Both the queen and her father were posthumously demoted to commoner status.In a book of unofficial history, Yeonryeosilkisul, it was said that King Sejo had felt the revenge of the deceased Queen Hyeondeok. ‘One day, Sejo had a dream of Queen Hyeondeok, who appeared in full wrath and said, “You killed my son who did nothing wrong, so I will do the same to your children. Remember that.” Sejo woke up in shock and suddenly, he received the news that the Crown Prince (Sejo’s firstborn son Crown Prince Uigyeong) had passed away. Because of that reason, Soreung (Queen Hyeondeok’s tomb) was dug up.’Her status was later restored during King Jungjong’s reign and her remains were moved to Hyeonreung to be buried alongside Munjong of Joseon.
