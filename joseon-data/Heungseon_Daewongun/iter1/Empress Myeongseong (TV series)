? - Karl Ivanovich Weber; He strives to expand Russian power in Joseon through the Imperial Russian Federation. When Empress Myeongseong leans toward her pro-Russia, she actively cooperates with it (discussing arms imports), but is consistent with a passive attitude when the Eulmi Incident takes place. Later, when the Agwan collapse occurred, he led the pro-Russian cabinet and tried to gain interest in Korea.
Kim Jin-ah - Sontak; German-Russian woman. Executioner of Weber and interpreter of the Imperial Russian Legation. She speaks fluent Russian in a scene where Prince Weber and Empress Myeongseong discuss arms imports.Britain figures

? - Isabella Bird; An English geographer and writer who wrote Korea and its neighbors, a story of her travels to Joseon. In the first scene of episode 1, a western woman played Isabella Budd Bishop, who is clumsy in the Joseon Dynasty, but eats rice with chopsticks.American figures 

? - Dayi; A foreign training instructor who disbanded a training unit trained by a Japanese military officer and took charge of training the newly created demonstrators. At the time of the Eulmi Incident, he led the protesters against the Japanese army, but was defeated and taken prisoner due to the inferiority of the troops.

Two Empress Myeongseong Actresses
It was reported that Lee Mi-Yeon signed a contract with KBS for this drama for only 100 episodes. However, due to high viewership rates, KBS wanted to extend the episodes for more than 100 originally. Since Lee Mi-Yeon wanted to stick with the original contract, she refused to do more 
than 100 episodes. However, KBS said still extended Empress Myeongseong and had Choi Myung-Gil for the role. Lee Mi-Yeon's last episode was Episode 81 and Choi Myung-Gil started at Episode 82. The viewers should not be confused as Lee Mi-Yeon also had a death scene which is actually a music video for the OST.
