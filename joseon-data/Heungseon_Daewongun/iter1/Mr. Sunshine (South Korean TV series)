The series is set in Hanseong (present-day Seoul) in the early 1900s, and focuses on activists fighting for Korea's independence. The series aired every Saturday and Sunday on tvN starting from July 7, 2018, and ended on September 30, 2018.

While it received critical acclaim for cinematography and storytelling, as well as its strong female characters and portrayal of the lower classes, the series also received a certain amount of criticism for what was perceived as inaccurate representation of historical facts, with some accusing it of being "pro-Japanese", while others argued that it actually enforced stereotypes of the Japanese as villains and the Americans as heroes.

Synopsis
Mr. Sunshine centres around Eugene Choi (Lee Byung-hun), who was born into slavery in Joseon. After escaping to the United States at the time of the 1871 Shinmiyangyo, he becomes a Marine Corps officer.
When he returns to Joseon for a mission, Eugene meets and falls in love with an aristocrat's granddaughter, Go Ae-shin (Kim Tae-ri), who is part of the Righteous Army. However, their love is challenged by their different classes and the presence of Kim Hui-seong (Byun Yo-han), a nobleman who has been Ae-shin's betrothed since childhood. Eugene also encounters Gu Dong-mae (Yoo Yeon-seok), a ruthless samurai, and Kudo Hina (Kim Min-jung), owner of the popular "Glory Hotel". At the same time, he discovers a plot by the Empire of Japan to colonize Korea and soon becomes embroiled in the fight for his birth country's sovereignty.

Historical background
Unlike most sageuk dramas dealing with the Japanese occupation of Korea, Mr. Sunshine takes place before the Japanese annexation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has a heavy focus on the Righteous Army and depicts the lives of people who fought for Joseon's freedom. Real-life historical events such as Shinmiyangyo, the Spanish-American War, the assassination of Empress Myeongseong, the Russo-Japanese War, Gojong's forced abdication, and the Battle of Namdaemun are portrayed or mentioned.Historical figures such as Emperor Gojong, Itō Hirobumi, Hayashi Gonsuke, Hasegawa Yoshimichi, Horace Newton Allen and the Five Eulsa Traitors appear as recurring characters, with others, such as Theodore Roosevelt, Ahn Chang-ho, Imperial Noble Consort Sunheon, Park Seung-hwan, and Frederick Arthur MacKenzie, also making cameo appearances.

Main historical events described in Mr. Sunshine
Battle of Ganghwa (1871): A major battle that occurred on June 10, 1871 between the United States and Joseon. On June 1, American ships came under fire when they entered the Ganghwa Straits to establish trade and ensure the safety of the shipwrecked sailors of the SS Sherman, which was destroyed by the Korean army. As a result of Joseon's refusal to apologize, on June 10, USS Palos and USS Monocacy fired their weapons against the Choji Garrison on Ganghwa Island. The incident is thoroughly portrayed in Mr. Sunshine, as one of its character, Jang Seung-gu, fought in the battle as a teen and lost his father.
Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905: Signed on November 17, 1905, this treaty effectively gave the Empire of Japan diplomatic control over Korea. While Mr. Sunshine does not depict the treaty and its effects in detail, it contains a scene in which Kim Hui-seong takes pictures of the pro-Japanese Korean officials.
Battle of Namdaemun: Fought between the Korean and Japanese armies on August 1, 1907, the battle took place at the Namdaemun Gate, in Hanseong. It was caused by a revolt of the Korean army after an order of disbandment was issued through the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907. In Mr. Sunshine, the battle scenes are extensively illustrated.

Production
Netflix invested ₩30 billion in the series.
The series is the third collaboration between writer Kim Eun-sook and director Lee Eung-bok, after Descendants of the Sun (2016) and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (2016).
The drama marks film actress Kim Tae-ri's small-screen debut.
The drama was first pitched by Studio Dragon to SBS, but the latter passed on the project due to financial and advertising constraints.
Kim Sa-rang was originally cast in the series, but backed out in February 2018 due to scheduling conflicts. She was replaced by Kim Min-jung.
Filming began in September 2017 and took place in various parts of Korea including Busan, Daegu, Gokseong County, Gyeongju and Hapcheon County. Several sets solely devoted to the early 1900s setting of Korea were built on a 20,000 m2 site in Nonsan, South Chungcheong Province, and another indoor set was built on a 6,600 m2 site in Daejeon. 1000 extras were hired for a battle scene.
It was originally planned in 2009 to be a sports-themed period drama set in the 1920s and 1930s, also featuring an American lead character. Shin Woo-chul, Kim Eun-sook's collaborator for the "Lovers" trilogy, was attached to be the director at the time.

Original soundtrack
The music was composed by Nam Hye-seung, who is known for her work on many Korean dramas. Mr. Sunshine's score was recorded at the newly opened Synchron Stage Vienna in Austria. Nam Hye-seung travelled to Vienna to attend the recording in person.

Reception
Critics praised the drama for its "deep storytelling" and its ability to raise viewers' awareness of history. The Korea Times applauded the drama for shedding light on those deemed peripheral in society, such as women and the lower classes, and for successfully laying out contradictions and hope in the fast-evolving late Joseon period; it also praised the show's strong female characters. Time's Kat Moon chose the show as one of the 10 "Best Korean Dramas to Watch on Netflix" and argued, "Besides serving up stunning cinematography, the show introduces two of the most dynamic female leads from the K-drama world". Collider's Devon Forward listed it as one of the 28 "Best Korean Dramas on Netflix Right Now".

Criticism
Mr. Sunshine has been criticized by some for what was perceived as inaccurate portrayal of Joseon's culture. In particular, the character Gu Dong-mae, who is portrayed as a member of the Black Dragon Society, a pro-Japanese organization, was criticized, with many feeling that the series tried to justify his actions against Joseon. However, the series has also been criticized for the exact opposite: enforcing stereotypes of the Japanese as villains and the Americans as heroes.The production house responded to the criticisms by stating that the organizations and characters portrayed in the series are fictional and that they will modify the character description of Gu Dong-mae accordingly. The Black Dragon Society was changed to a fictional organization, the Musin Society.

Viewership
At the time, Mr. Sunshine recorded the third highest ratings for cable television with its final episode reaching 18.129% and netting an average rating of 12.955%, which was the highest average rating ever recorded for cable television until the release of The World of the Married, in 2020.An 8.9% viewership rating was recorded nationwide for the series' first episode. It became the highest premiere rating in the network's history and remained in this position for the next three years, until it was surpassed by Hospital Playlist 2.The drama aired on a cable channel/pay TV which normally has a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS).
