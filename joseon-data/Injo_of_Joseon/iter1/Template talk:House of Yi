As there is no "Fixed edit of pretender see talk," I clarify the reason of reverting edits from Theoneyihistorian. There is no "Joseon Empire", and the Korean Empire is already gone at present. And if there is a so-called "company", the "Korean Imperial Family Cultural Foundation" founded by Yi Seok, is more like one, instead of Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association. -
