Princess Hyomyeong (1638 - September 1700), was the only daughter of King Injo of Joseon with Royal Consort Gwi-in of the Okcheon Jo clan.

Biography
The princess was born in 1638 during her father’s 24th year of reign. 
Prior to her birth, Queen Inryeol had given birth to a princess in 1626 but died prematurely. With the birth of being the only princess within princes, King Injo showered her with affection.
She was formally invested as a princess in her 11th year in 1647 when she was given her title Princess Hyomyeong (효명옹주, 孝明翁主), and the selection for her consort was held in the same year.  
It was said that King Injo let her have the option of choosing her husband, but Royal Consort Gwi-in Jo had manipulated the outcome with the consent from Kim Ja-jeom. Thus arranged for her daughter to be matched with Kim Ja-jeom’s grandson, Kim Se-ryung, and eventually they were married. 
She continued to live in the palace after the marriage and only left to live outside the palace two years later. King Injo cherished her deeply, resulting in her self-centered behaviour and bad relationship with her sister-in-law. After King Injo’s death, Lady Gwi-in Jo was accused of putting curses on Queen Jangryeol and King Hyojong, and Princess Hyomyeong admitted to burying unlucky things in the palace and Grand Prince Inpyeong’s residence with regard to the curse.
Although there were requests to interrogate both Princess Hyomyeong and Kim Se-ryung, only her husband was questioned, and was sentenced to death in 1651, as was his grandfather Kim Ja-jeom. She was then stripped of her title, only known as Kim Se-ryung’s wife (김세룡의 처) from then on.
The princess was exiled to Tongcheon but was soon relocated to Icheon since the weather in Tongcheon was cold that year. In 1655, King Hyojong ordered for her place of exile to be moved again in order for her to live together with her siblings, Prince Sungseon and Prince Nakseon. Three years later, she was released from the sentence and continued to live under close surveillance until her death in September 1700 when she was 64 years old during King Sukjong’s 24th year of reign.
