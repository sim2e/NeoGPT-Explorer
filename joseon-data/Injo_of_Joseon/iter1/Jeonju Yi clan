The Jeonju Yi clan (Korean: 전주 이씨; Hanja: 全州 李氏) is a Korean clan with the surname Yi. Their Bon-gwan is in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. The clan includes the former House of Yi which ruled the Joseon dynasty and the Korean Empire.
Their founder was Yi Han. His descendant, Yi Seong-gye, seized power in a military coup and founded Joseon in 14th century. 
According to history books published during the Joseon period such as Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty, he was Minister of Works (사공; 司空) during the Silla Dynasty and became the ancestor of a prestigious and powerful clan that held influence from the Unified Silla period to the Goryeo period. On the other hand, there were records that he was an immigrant from China. This is because the Jeonju Yi clan's record named Wansan Silrok said that Yi Han originally lived in China, but he later came to Silla. Moreover, another record named Origin of Yi clan (이씨 득성의 유래; 李氏得姓之由來) said that Yi Han was originally a descendant of Tang Dynasty's imperial family and lived in Jeonju after he came to Silla.
In the 21st century, the Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association manages the affairs of the clan.
