Gu Sa-maeng (Hangul: 구사맹, Hanja: 具思孟; 1531–1604) was a 16th century Korean nobleman, military officer and minister. He was the father of Queen Inheon and the maternal grandfather of Injo of Joseon.

Life
In 1549 (4th year of King Myeongjong), Gu Sa-maeng was appointed as Jinsa (진사). In 1558, at 27 years old he passed the national examination as a military officer and worked in Seungmunwon (승문원, 承文院) as an inspector.In 1560, he become a general and three years later, he went to the Ming Dynasty as the secretary of Saeun Temple. He spent the following years as Ijojwarang (이조좌랑) and Ijojeongnang (이조정랑).
In 1567 after King Myeongjong's death, Gu become Binjeondogamjejo (빈전도감제조, 殯殿都監提調). Two years later, in 1569 (2nd year of King Seonjo's reign), he was appointed as the Governor of Hwanghae Province.
In 1587, one of his youngest daughters married Grand Prince Jeongwon, the son of King Seonjo, and became the mother to three sons; one of them becoming the future king.
From then on, he started to serve in numerous government posts in the central and local areas during the reign of Seonjo of Joseon. Meanwhile, during the Imjin War (임진왜란), in 1597 (30th year of King Seonjo's reign), Gu served some of the Royal Princes. At this time, he was a Right Chamchan (2nd senior rank; 우참찬, 右參贊).Gu Sa-maeng died on April 1, 1604 (37th year of King Seonjo's reign), at the age of 74 years old due to the relapse of his chronic disease, which had plagued him since he was working in the Uigeumbu.
After his grandson ascended the throne as King Injo, along with posthumously honouring his parents as King and Queen, he also honoured his maternal grandfather as Internal Prince Neungan (능안부원군, 綾安府院君).It was said that in Gu's eulogy, it was written that he was a simple and quiet man by nature, and also liked frugality. So he didn't own land or a house, but only enjoyed his coat of arms ("천성이 담백하고 조용하였으며, 검소한 것을 좋아하여 땅이나 집을 장만하지 않고 오로지 문장을 즐겼다.").His tomb is located in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, along with his two wives, Lady Han (한씨) and Lady Shin (신씨).
