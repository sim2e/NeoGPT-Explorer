Kim Jo-sun (Korean: 김조순; Hanja: 金祖淳; 1765 — 1832) was a Korean political figure during the late Joseon period. He came from the (new) Andong Kim clan (신 안동 김씨, 新 安東 金氏). He served as a minister in the royal court and orchestrated the Andong Kim clan's takeover of power. He was the father of Queen Sunwon. After his daughter became the Queen Consort, his son-in-law, Sunjo of Joseon, honored him as the Internal Prince Yeongan (영안 부원군, 永安 府院君).

Political influence
After Queen Jeongsun stepped down as regent, Kim Jo-sun, already held an influential court member, purged his political rivals to help secure the position of his family and political faction. This began the era of Sedo politics, or oligarchic rule, of the Andong Kim clan. Kim was a leading member of the Noron Faction. This marked the beginning of a sixty-year period, spanning the reign of three kings (Sunjo, Heonjong, and Cheoljong), in which the real power in the country was wielded by the Andong Kims.
Kim Jo-sun acted as regent for Sunjo, with the reins of power firmly in his grip. Local magistrates and provincial governors alike had to curry favor with the Andong Kim clan to maintain their positions. Kim Jo-sun's son, Kim Jwa-geun, took over the Andong Kim clan as it was attaining the height of its influence.
