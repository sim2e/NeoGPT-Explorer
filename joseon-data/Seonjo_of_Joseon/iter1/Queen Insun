Biography
Early life
Lady Sim was born on 27 June 1532 to Sim Kang and Lady Yi of the Jeonju Yi clan. She is the eldest within 10 siblings, including Sim Ui-gyeom. Through her mother, she is a 6th great-granddaughter of Queen Wongyeong and King Taejong; through her 5th great-grandfather, Grand Prince Hyoryeong.

Marriage
In April 1542, Lady Sim was arranged to marry Grand Prince Gyeongwon; the only son of King Jungjong and Queen Munjeong. Lady Sim was given the title of Princess Consort (부부인).

Queen
In 1545, when King Injong passed away, her husband was enthroned as the next king of joseon as there wasn't any heirs from Queen Inseong. The Princess Consort then became the next Queen Consort and had a son, Crown Prince Sunhoe, in 1551.
The Crown Prince died in 1563; leaving no heirs from King Myeongjong who also died in 1567. This left Prince Haseong (the future King Seonjo), a son of Grand Internal Prince Deokheung and Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong, to become the next crowned prince.

Regency and later life
The Queen Consort became Queen Regent in 1567 upon on the prince's enthronement as king because he was young. In 1568, she stepped down as regent and became Queen Dowager. She was later given the title of Uiseong (의성, 懿聖) in 1569.
Her reign as Queen Dowager lasted 8 years as she died on 12 February 1575 within Changgyeong Palace's Tongmyeong Hall. Nearby where her mother-in-law, Queen Munjeong, is buried, the Queen is buried with her husband in Kangreung.

Trivia
