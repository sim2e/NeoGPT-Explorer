Han Myeong-hoe (Hangul: 한명회, Hanja: 韓明澮; 26 November 1415 – 28 November 1487) was a Korean politician and soldier during the Joseon period.
He was the most trusted tactician of Grand Prince Suyang during the 1453 coup and the subsequent events that resulted into Suyang becoming King Sejo. He was listed as a first rank meritorious subject in 1453 (정난공신, 靖難功臣) and in 1455 (좌익공신, 佐翼功臣).In 1460, his third daughter, Han Naeng-yi, married Crown Prince Haeyang (the future King Yejong).
Between 1466 – 1467, Han Myeong-hoe became the Chief State Councillor of Joseon, and his youngest daughter, Han Song-yi, married Prince Jalsan (the future King Seongjong).
In 1468, Crown Prince Haeyang became Yejong, the 8th King of the Joseon Dynasty, and Han Myeong-hoe's daughter, Han Naeng-yi, was posthumously honoured Queen Jangsun and her father was reappointed Chief State Councillor.
In 1469, when Yejong died, Han Myeong-hoe was instrumental in the decision to recuse both Yejong's son as too young and Jalsan's older brother as too weak. As a result, Jalsan was chosen to become King Seongjong, the 9th King of the Joseon Dynasty, with Han Song-yi as Queen Consort (posthumously known as Queen Gonghye).
