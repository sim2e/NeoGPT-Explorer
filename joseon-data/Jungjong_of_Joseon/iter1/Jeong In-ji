Jeong In-ji (Korean: 정인지; Hanja: 鄭麟趾; December 28, 1396 – November 26, 1478) was a Korean Neo-Confucian scholar, historian who served as Vice Minister of Education or Deputy Chief Scholar (Head of Office for Special Advisors) during the reign of King Sejong the Great, Minister of Rites during the reign of King Munjong and Danjong, Left or Second State Councillor from 1453 to 1455 during the reign of King Danjong, and Chief State Councillor from 1455 to 1458 during the reign of King Sejo. He was nicknamed Hakyeokjae (학역재). He was from the Hadong Jeong clan (하동 정씨, 河東 鄭氏)

He is perhaps best known for having written the postscript of the Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye, the commentary on and explanation of the native alphabet Hangeul invented by King Sejong in 1443. He also contributed to the Goryeo-sa, the official history of the Goryeo dynasty, and the Yongbi Eocheon-ga (용비어천가).
His second son, Jeong Hyeon-jo, was married to Princess Uisuk, the second daughter of King Sejo of Joseon. His descendants would eventually have royal connections through their marriages.
