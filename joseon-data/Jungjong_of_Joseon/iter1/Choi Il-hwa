Controversy
On February 25, 2018, Choi admitted to being guilty of sexual harassment, and was subsequently removed from the MBC drama Hold Me Tight, as well as his position on the board of directors for the Korean Actors Association and academic advisor at Sejong University. However, on February 28, it was revealed later by an actress that he had actually committed sexual assault by raping her 25 years ago. Choi came under harsh criticism, as the possibility that Choi may have only confessed because he knew his name would be mentioned by the media was raised.
