Queen Uiin (의인왕후 박씨; 5 May 1555 – 5 August 1600), of the Bannam Park clan, was a posthumous name bestowed to the first wife and first queen consort of Yi Yeon, King Seonjo, the 14th Joseon monarch. She was queen consort of Joseon from 1569 until her death in 1600.

Life
Early life
The future queen was born on 5 May 1555 during the reign of King Myeongjong. Her father, Park Eung-sun, was member of the Bannam Park clan. Her mother was member of the Jeonju Yi clan. She had an older brother. 
Through her mother, Lady Park is a first cousin fifth times removed of her future husband, King Seonjo. King Seonjo and Lady Park both share King Sejong as their ancestor as he’s their 5th great-grandfather. King Seonjo’s father, Internal Grand Prince Deokheung, is the 3rd great-grandson of King Sejong, and King Seonjo’s mother, Internal Grand Princess Consort Hadong, is also the 3rd great-granddaughter of King Sejong.
Through her maternal 3rd great-grandmother, she is also a 4th great-granddaughter of Han Hwak and a 3rd great-grandniece of Queen Sohye; the mother of King Seongjong and daughter of Han Hwak.
Her first cousin, Park Mi, eventually became the 5th great-grandfather of Park Myeong-won; the husband of Princess Hwapyeong who was the eldest daughter of King Yeongjo and Royal Noble Consort Yeong.

Life as queen consort
She became queen consort at the age of 15 in 1569 when she married the 17-year-old King Seonjo. Her mother was given the royal title of "Internal Princess Consort Wansan" (완산부부인) and her father being given the title of "Internal Prince Banseong" (반성부원군).
But being unable to bear children had caused her to be alienated by her husband who went to concubines to produce heirs. She built Buddhist temples all over the country for her to pray in and made frequent donations to the temples, including Geonbongsa and Beopjusa.

Imjin War and death
After the Imjin War, Seonjo fled to Uiju to seek protection, bringing his concubine, Royal Noble Consort In of the Suwon Kim clan (인빈 김씨) and the Queen with him. But the Queen got separated on their way to their seek shelter, and so the Queen fled to Pyeonganam Island, Pyeongan Province. The King and Kim Inbin returned to the capital, but the Queen decided to stay in Haeju until 1597.
When the Second Invasion happened, Seonjo once again fled with Kim In-Bin but this time, the Queen fled together with Crown Prince Gwanghae. Her health deteriorated because of constantly moving from one place to another, and she later died at the age of 45 without any issue. She posthumously honoured as Queen Uiin (의인왕후).
