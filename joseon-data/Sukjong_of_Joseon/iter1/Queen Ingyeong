Queen Ingyeong (인경왕후 김씨; 25 October 1661 − 16 December 1680), of the Gwangsan Kim clan, was a posthumous name bestowed to the wife and first queen consort of Yi Sun, King Sukjong, the 19th Joseon monarch. She was queen consort of Joseon from 1674 until her death in 1680.

Biography
The future queen was born on 25 October 1661 during the reign of King Hyeonjong. Her name was Kim Ok-hye (김옥혜, 金玉惠).
Her father was Kim Man-gi and her mother was member of the Cheongju Han clan. Kim Jang-saeng was her great-great grandfather and Kim Jib was her great-granduncle through her father. She was a second cousin twice removed of Queen Inseon as well as a second cousin once removed of Queen Hyosun.
She was married at the age of 10 to Hyeonjong's only son, Crown Prince Myeongbo, entitling her as crown princess consort (왕세자빈, wangsejabin). In 1674, her husband ascended to the throne as the 19th Joseon monarch (temple name: Sukjong) and she became queen consort.
In 1677, she gave birth to a daughter who eventually died a year later on 13 March 1678. In 1679, the Queen gave birth to another daughter but she died prematurely a day later. In the summer of 1680, she had been pregnant, but due to an incident she had a miscarriage.
On 8 December 1680, age 19, she showed signs of smallpox and later died on December 16 in Gyeongdeok Palace (now known as Gyeonghui Palace). She is buried in Ikreung (익릉) in Gyeonggi province.
