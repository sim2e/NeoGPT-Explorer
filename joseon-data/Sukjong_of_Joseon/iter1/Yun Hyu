Yun Hyu (Hangul: 윤휴, Hanja: 尹鑴; 1617 – 1680) was a Korean Neo-Confucian scholar and official, who lived during the Joseon Dynasty. Yun was the political leader of the Southern (Namin) faction of the Joseon Dynasty. His pen names were Baekho, Haheon and Yabo.He was nominated to be a Jipyeong (지평, 持平) as a Yebinshijeong (예빈시정, 禮賓寺正), and had served in various other posts, before he left politics to dedicate himself to scholarly pursuits.
In 1660, he became a leading figure in the controversy regarding the mourning rituals for King Hyojong. In 1674, he became involved again in a second round of the controversy, this time over the death of Queen Inseon.
In 1680, Yun was expelled and exiled to Gapsan (갑산, 甲山). That year, he was ordered to commit suicide by King Sukjong, after a long public debate with Song Si-yeol.
