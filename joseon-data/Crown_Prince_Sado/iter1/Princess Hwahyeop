In the 1970s, the coffins of the couple was shifted to another burial site in Jingeon-myeon (真乾邑), Namyangju, by their descendants for an unknown reason. Therefore, only traces of their coffins were found in this original burial site.Characters carved on stone blocks placed on the right-hand side of the tomb were used to identify its occupant.
