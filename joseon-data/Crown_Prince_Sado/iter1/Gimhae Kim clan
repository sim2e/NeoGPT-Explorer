The Gimhae Kim clan (Korean: 김해 김씨; Hanja: 金海 金氏) is a Korean clan, descended from Suro of Geumgwan Gaya. King Suro was the founder of Gaya confederacy, and his descendant, Kim Yu-sin is renowned for leading the Silla armies to unify the Three Kingdoms of Korea. 
More than six million present day Koreans, especially from Gimhae Kim, Heo and Lee (Yi) clans associate their Bon-gwan (geo-biological lineage roots) to Gimhae, in the South Gyeongsang Province of South Korea, and these clans place restrictions on marriage with each other due to the shared ancestors. Today, the Gimhae Kim clan is the largest clan group among them. The Gimhae Kim and Gimhae Heo clans, descend from the two sons of King Suro where the latter used their mother, Queen Heo Hwang-ok's surname, instead of their father's.
One of the dominant branch of Gimhae Kim clan is Samhyunpa-branch.
