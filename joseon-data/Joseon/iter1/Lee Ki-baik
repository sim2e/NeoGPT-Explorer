Ki-baik Lee (Korean: 이기백; 1924–2004) was a South Korean historian. He was born in Jeongju-gun, in North Pyeongan province in what is today North Korea. He graduated from the Osan School in 1941, attending Waseda University in Tokyo but ultimately graduating from Seoul National University in 1947.
Lee was a notable historian. He served as Professor of History at Sogang University, Seoul. His most noted work was the New History of Korea (Kuksa Sillon, to echo Shin Chaeho's 1908 Doksa Sillon), first published in 1967 and revised thereafter. New History of Korea was published in English in translation by Edward W. Wagner.
