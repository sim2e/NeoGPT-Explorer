Noktundo (Korean: 록둔도; 녹둔도) was an island in the delta of the Tumen River on the border between Primorsky Krai, Russia and North Korea. The area of the island was 3.2 square kilometres (1.2 sq mi).In the 15th century, Noktundo belonged to the Koreans. The island was fertile to grow crops, and located in a strategic position for advancement into the Korean peninsula. The Jurchens took notice of this. In 1587 there was a battle fought on this island between the local Koreans and the invading barbarian Jurchens from nearby Russia. At first, the Jurchens successfully sacked the island and captured 160 Koreans as prisoners. As they crossed the river back to their camp with the prisoners, the famed Korean general Yi Sun-Shin, chased after the invaders and rescued 50 Koreans and defended the island. With his army, he later infiltrated the nearby Jurchen army camp, and captured their leader alive. At the time of the shallowing of the northern branch of the Tumen, the course of the river changed from time to time. As a result, the island of Noktundo was sometimes joined with the mainland of Primorsky Krai. Regardless, the island remained under Korean jurisdiction.
The island was under Korean control until 1860 Convention of Peking, when the Russian Empire took over the island. When the Joseon government found this out in the 1880s, this became a matter of protest to the Koreans, who claimed that the Russians had no authority to do so, and protested it to the Qing dynasty. In 1990, Soviet Union and North Korea signed a border treaty which made the border run through the center of the river leaving the territory of the former island on the Russian side. South Korea refused to acknowledge the treaty and demanded that Russia return the territory to Korea.
