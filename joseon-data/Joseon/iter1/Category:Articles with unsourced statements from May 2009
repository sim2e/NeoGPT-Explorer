This category combines all articles that are missing citations for specific statements, tagged since the given month (or before), from May 2009 (2009-05) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Articles with unsourced statements.
Adding {{Fact}} after an unsourced statement will add the article to this category. Use {{Citations missing}} for articles that cite some sources, but insufficiently.
Please use {{Unreferenced}} for articles that do not cite any sources at all. See Category:Articles lacking sources for pages that have no identified source material.
You can also participate in Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check.

Please help improve an article in this category by adding references to reliable sources that verify content within the article. Once the reliable source references have been added, the unsourced (citation needed) tag can be removed.
