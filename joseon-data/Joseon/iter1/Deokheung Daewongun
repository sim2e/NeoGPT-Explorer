Biography
Early life
The future Grand Internal Prince Deokheung was born on 2 April 1530 as the 9th son of Jungjong of Joseon and his second son with Royal Noble Consort Chang of the Ansan An clan, the daughter of An Tan-Dae (안탄대) who was the member of Uijeongbu (의정부). He was firstly named Yi Hwan-su (이환수) and later was changed into Yi Cho (이초). Then, on 1538 (33rd year reign of his father), he honoured as Prince Deokheung (덕흥군, 德興君).

Marriage and later life
In 1542, the grandson of Jeong In-Ji (정인지), Jeong Se-Ho (정세호)'s daughter, Lady of the Hadong Jeong clan (하동 정씨) (the future Hadong Budaebuin) went to his house in Dojeong Palace, Sajik-dong, Hanseong-bu and then they were married. Later, in March 1554, both of his house and his father in-law's house were impeached by some of Ministers, but his half younger brother, King Myeongjong defeated them. Deokheung and his wife had 3 sons and 1 daughter. He also had one concubine named Sun-Dan (순단) and with her, he had one daughter whom named Yi Hye-Ok (이혜옥).

Seonjo's ascension to the throne
During his lifetime, based on Myeongjong's Annals, he was criticized for being ignorant.  In 1567, his third son, Yi Yeon, Prince Haseong (이연 하성군) succeeded Myeongjong who died without any royal heir as the 14th King of Joseon. Meanwhile, those servants who were negative about Myeongjong did not object to the success of Yi-Yeon and immediately agreed.
In 1 November 1569 (2nd year reign of his son), he and his wife, as the biological parents of the King were given royal title from Prince Deokheung become Grand Internal Prince Deokheung (덕흥대원군, 德興大院君) and from Princess Consort Hadong become Grand Internal Princess Consort Hadong (하동부대부인, 河東府大夫人). After that, the family shrine was established in Dojeong Palace (도정궁) and under the support from Jamjeo (잠저).
Deokheung later died on 14 June 1559 and was buried in San 5–13, Deoksong-ri, Byeolnae-myeon, Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea (Surak Mountain?) and King Seonjo called his father's tomb Deokneung (덕릉).
