Queen Sinui (Hangul: 신의왕후 한씨, Hanja: 神懿王后 韓氏; 6 October 1337 – 25 November 1391), of the Cheongju Han clan, was the first wife of Yi Seong-gye (future Taejo of Joseon). She was the mother of King Jeongjong and King Taejong.She was firstly given the title of Queen Jeol (절비, 節妃) in 1393. After her second son (Yi Bang-gwa) became King, she was posthumously honored as Queen Sinui (신의왕후, 神懿王后). In 1899, after the founding of the Korean Empire, she was posthumously called Sinui, the High Empress (신의고황후, 神懿高皇后).

Biography
Early life
The future Queen Sinui was born during King Chungsuk of Goryeo’s 5th year of reign on 6 October 1337. Born into the Cheongju Han clan, Lady Han was the eldest child within seven siblings to Han Gyeong and his wife, Lady Shin of the Saknyeong Shin clan. 
In some sources, she is noted as a member of the Anbyeon Han clan, which was founded by Han Ryeon (한련, 韓漣), a ninth-generation descendant of Han Ran (한란, 韓蘭), the progenitor of the Cheongju Han clan.

Marriage and later life
In 1351, when she was 15 years old, she was arranged to marry Yi Seong-gye who was 2 years older than her. She later gave birth to 6 sons and 2 daughters from 1354 to 1370s. While Yi Seong-gye (later Yi Dan) was traveling through the battlefield, Lady Han took care of the household affairs in his hometown and helped out. 
During the Goryeo Dynasty, aristocratic men were allowed two wives; one wife was known as the Gyeongcheo (경처), the capital wife, while the other wife was known as the Hyangcheo (향처), the countryside wife. In Gaegyeong (modern-day Kaeseong), Yi Seong-gye welcomed Lady Kang, a daughter of Kang Yun-seong, from the noble Goksan Kang clan, as his second, Gyeongcheo, wife. Lady Kang would later become Queen Hyeon.
In 1388, during the 14th year of King U of Goryeo’s reign, Lady Han stayed in Jaebyeok-dong, Pocheon, and fled back to Dongbuk-myeon with her children and remaining family under the guidance of her fifth son Yi Bang-won. This eventually led her to be concerned about the threat of her life and she later passed away on 4 September 1391 at the age of 54. Her tomb is called Jeneung and is located in present-day Kaesong, North Korea.

Aftermath
A year after Lady Han’s death, her husband established the Joseon Dynasty; thus having her husband become king and her children become princes and princesses.
During King Taejo’s 2nd year of reign in 1393, she was posthumously given the title of Queen Jeol (절비, 節妃; Jeolbi meaning Faithful Consort). In 1398, during the first year of reign of her second eldest son, King Jeongjong, Lady Han was honored as Queen Sinui (신의왕후, 神懿王后).
After the death of Queen Hyeon in 1396, Queen Shinui's fifth son, Yi Bang-won, eventually led a coup d'etat with his wife, Princess Jeongnyeong’s encouragement, while King Taejo was in mourning for his second wife. This event led to the deaths of Jeong Do-jeon and his supporters, as well as the late Queen Sindeok's two sons: Yi Bang-beon, Grand Prince Muan and Yi Bang-seok, Grand Prince Uian. This incident became known as the First Strife of Princes.
