Biography
His mother, Lady Hyegyeong, of Pungsan was from a famous royal family line.  His maternal grandfather was Hong Bong-han, whose younger brother was Hong In-han, a minister and later Prime Minister of that time.
He was the first grandson of the 21st King Yeongjo of Joseon and his father, Crown Prince Sado, was the illegitimate second son of King Yeongjo. King Yeongjo's first son, Crown Prince Hyojang, died at the age of 10, leaving Crown Prince Sado as King Yeongjo's only male descendant.  King Yeongjo hoped for another son but instead bore only daughters.
Uiso's father Crown Prince Sado had a severe mental illness and was often at odds with his father, King Yeongjo.  Crown Prince Sado favoured the political party Soron, while King Yeongjo supported the ruling party Noron.  Later King Yeongjo had his son, Crown Prince Sado, executed by locking him in a rice chest and starving him.
On September 27, 1750 he was born Changgyeong Palace Gyeongchun Hall, in Hanseong. King Yeongjo expected great things from him. On May 13, 1751 King Yeongjo declared him the political heir.
In November 1751, his aunt Lady Hyeonbin died, then soon after on 17 April 1752, Crown Prince Uiso died Tongmyongjeon. His grandfather, King Yeongjo took the deaths hard and severed from psychological trauma for some time.
He was given a state funeral of Joseons, from special instructions of King Yeongjo. His body was buried to the south of Mt. Ahnhyon (안현 鞍峴), Bugahyeon-dong in Hanseong. King Yeongjo named his grave Uiso grave and wrote the epitaphs, erecting a tombstone.
In 1870, his grave name was Uiryong Park (의령원 懿寧園). On June 7, 1949, his grave was moved to Wondang in Goyang.
