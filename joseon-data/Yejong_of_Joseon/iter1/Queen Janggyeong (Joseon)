Queen Janggyeong (10 August 1491 – 16 March 1515), of the Papyeong Yun clan, was the wife and second queen consort of Yi Yeok, King Jungjong, the 11th Joseon monarch. She was queen consort of Joseon from 1507 until her death in 1515.

Life
Yun Myeong-hye (윤명혜) was born on 10 August 1491 during the twenty-second year reign of King Seongjong. Her father, Yun Yeo-pil, was member of the Papyeong Yun clan and her mother was member of the Suncheon Park clan (순천 박씨, 順天 朴氏). She was the fifth child within her six siblings and the fourth daughter within her five sisters, and her only older brother, Yun Im.
Through her father, she is a third cousin of Queen Munjeong and Yun Won-hyeong, as well as a great-grandniece of Queen Jeonghui. Her father's sister married a first cousin once removed of Queen Jeongsun; thus making her aunt be a daughter-in-law to Im Sa-hong. As well as a sister-in-law to Yi Hang, Prince Ahnyang (안양군 이항; 1480 - 1505); who was the son of King Seongjong and Royal Consort Gwi-in of the Chogye Jeong clan, and a grandaunt to Queen Inheon and a great-grandaunt to King Injo.
Because her mother died in 1498 after she gave birth to her younger sister, her maternal aunt, Grand Princess Consort Seungpyeong of the Suncheon Park clan, had raised her in her mother's stead. Although Yun Yeo-pil did not remarry, Lady Yun did have a younger half-sister. But her family or father's ancestry does not mention any record of a concubine or second mother besides her younger half-sister's name and birth year.
Lady Yun's eldest sister, Princess Papyeong, married Prince Deokpung (her half-cousin), who was the son of Grand Prince Wolsan (a son of Queen Insu) and the step-son of her maternal aunt.
In 1506 (during King Jungjong’s first year of reign), Lady Yun had entered the palace as a concubine for the King within the inner court list, granted the title suk-ui (숙의, 淑儀), junior 2nd rank concubine of the King. After Queen Dangyeong was deposed, Yun Suk-ui had been chosen from the other concubines, and became the Queen Consort of Joseon.
On 13 June 1511, the Queen gave birth to Princess Hyohye, the eldest daughter of King Jungjong, and on 10 March 1515, she later gave birth to a son, Yi Ho, the future King Injong.

Death
The Queen died six days later in Gyeongbok Palace within the quarters of Gong Palace’s Byeol Hall at the age of 24 due to postpartum sickness. She was buried in Huireung within the city of Goyang, Gyeonggi Province and posthumously honoured with the title Queen Janggyeong.

Aftermath
After her death, the 29-year-old King Jungjong later married the 17-year-old daughter of Yun Ji-im of the Papyeong Yun clan, posthumously honoured as Queen Munjeong, in 1517. She gave birth to Princess Uihye in 1521, Princess Hyosun in 1522, an unnamed child in 1528, Princess Gyeonghyeon in 1530, the future King Myeongjong of Joseon in 1535, and Princess Insun in 1542.
As the Crown Prince was the Queen's political protector for a long time, he later turned into a political enemy that she should get rid of for the future of her own son. The Annals of the Joseon Dynasty tells the story of the Queen who threatened the Crown Prince to not to kill her brothers and her own son. Her hostility was not only because her ambition, but also from Yun Im's and late Kim An-ro's manipulation to get rid of the Queen.
Many in the Sarim faction believed that Injong was poisoned by Seongryeol as the late Queen’s son, King Injong’s reign, had lasted only 9 months.but there is no evidence that this was the case. According to unofficial chronicles, there is a tale of Seongryeol finally showing love for her "adoptive" son Injong, after decades of polite indifference (in reality behind-the-scenes hatred).
With politically indifferences and trying to received the motherly love from his stepmother, it was speculated that Queen Munjeong had slowly poisoned her stepson, King Injong, by feeding him a tteok (rice cake). Which resulted him dying on 7 August 1545 thus giving the throne to her biological son, King Myeongjong of Joseon (King Injong's younger half-brother).
The chronicles also tell that Queen Dowager Seongryeol was frequently visited by spirits at night after Injong's death. As she was disturbed, she moved her residence from Gyeongbok Palace to Changdeok Palace.
Queen Munjeong eventually became Queen Regent throughout the reign of her son until she died twenty years later on 5 August 1565.
