King Chang of Goryeo (6 September 1380 – 31 December 1389) was the 33rd and youngest ruler of the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea. His life and death is often compared with Grand Prince Yeongchang.

Biography
Prince Chang was the only son of King U and Royal Consort Geun of the Goseong Yi clan, daughter of Yi Rim. King U was forced from power after Yi Seong-gye mutinied in 1388, and King Chang was put on the throne in his stead.
During his reign from June 1388 to November 1389, Chang experienced a great chaos of reforms. There were two factions: one wanted a conservational reform, and the other wanted a radical reform. The former was led by Cho Min-soo(曺敏修), and Yi Saek, and the latter was led by Yi Seong-gye, and Jeong Do-jeon. King Chang tried to arbitrate the two fractions. However, as Yi Saek lost his political power following the impeachment of Yi Sung-yin, King Chang lost his authority, bringing Yi Seong-gye to the greatest power.In November 1389, there was a rumor that former King U tried to assassinate Yi Seong-gye. This provided the reason for abdication of King Chang.King Chang was assassinated, together with his father, shortly after the ascension of Gongyang, whilst in exile. King Chang was 9 years of age.
