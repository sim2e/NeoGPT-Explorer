Yi Hae-won (Korean: 이해원; Hanja: 李海瑗; 24 April 1919 – 8 February 2020), also Lee Hae-won, was a member of House of Yi: the royal family of Joseon and the Korean Empire. She was born as the second daughter of Prince Imperial Ui who was the fifth son of Emperor Gojong of Korea. Her mother was one of Prince Ui's concubines, Lady Yi of Sudeok Hall. Yi was considered one of two pretenders to the throne, alongside her nephew, Yi Won.She died at the age of 100 in her house on Hanam City, Gyeonggi Province.

Birth and marriage
Yi Haewon was born in Sadong Palace, which was an official residence of her family in Keijō and raised in Unhyeon Palace. After she graduated from Kyunggi Girls' High School in 1937, she then married Yi Seunggyu, who was kidnapped and compulsorily taken to North Korea during the Korean War. They had three sons and one daughter.

Coronation
Following the death of her cousin Yi Ku on 16 July 2005, members of the imperial family chose his adopted son, Yi Won, as the next Head of the Korean Imperial Household, bestowing on him the title, the Hereditary Prince Imperial of Korea (Hwangsason), representative of an inherited title from Yi Ku. Contesting her nephew's claim and appointment to the throne, Yi Haewŏn announced the restoration of the Korean Imperial Household. A private coronation ceremony was held on 29 September 2006, during which Yi Haewŏn was bestowed the title, the "Empress of Korea". According to one of her half-brothers, Yi Seok, who was another pretender, other close royal member didn't approve such a ceremony; Yi Seok himself was also invited, but he didn't attend the ceremony, for he didn't know who the members of the "Imperial Family Association of Daehanjeguk" are.
