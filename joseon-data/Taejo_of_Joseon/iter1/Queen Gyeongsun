Queen Gyeongsun of the Munju Park clan (Korean: 경순왕후 박씨; Hanja: 敬順王后 朴氏) was the first wife of Yi Chun and mother of Yi Jachun who would become Joseon dynasty's founder, Yi Seonggye's father. She was posthumously honoured as Queen Gyeong (경비, 敬妣; Gyeong-bi; "the respectful queen") at first.

Biography
Lady Park was born as the daughter of a Yuan dynasty's Cheonho (천호, 千戶), Park Gwang, Internal Prince Anbyeon (박광 안변부원군) who was a son of Park Tong (박통, 朴通). She later married Yi Chun and had 5 sons and 3 daughters. After her death, instead of remarrying, her husband took Lady Jo (조씨), the daughter of Jo Yang-Gi (조양기), s a concubine. On 28 July 1392, her grandson, Yi Seong-Gye (이성계) established the new dynasty, the Joseon Dynasty. As the grandmother of the king, Lady Park was given royal title of Gyeongbi (경비, 敬妣; literally: Queen Gyeong or Consort Gyeong) and later on 22 April 1411, her great-grandson, Taejong of Joseon, gave her a posthumous name Queen Gyeongsun (경순왕후, 敬順王后). Her tomb was located in Sulleung, Heungnam-si, Hangyeongnam-do.
