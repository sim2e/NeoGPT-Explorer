The mingghan (Middle Mongolian: *mïŋgan) was a social-military unit of 1000 households created by Genghis Khan. From this group could be recruited a Mongol regiment of 1000 men. It is part of the ancient method of organization developed by the nomads of Central Asia based on the decimal system. A tumen, which included 10,000 households and soldiers, was the largest group and it was divided into ten mingghan. A mingghan was made up of 10 jaghuns or 100 arbans. An account cited that once he becomes a guard, it is the duty of a mingghan commander's son to bring a younger brother and 10 other men to serve with him.
