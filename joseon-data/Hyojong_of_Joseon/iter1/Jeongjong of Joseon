Jeongjong of Joseon (1 July 1357 – 26 September 1419), personal name Yi Bang-gwa (Korean: 이방과; Hanja: 李芳果), later Yi Gyeong (Korean: 이경; Hanja: 李曔), was the second ruler of the Joseon dynasty of Korea. He was the second son of King Taejo, the founder of the dynasty. Before rising to power, he was known as Prince Yeongan (Korean: 영안군; Hanja: 永安君).

Biography
Born in 1357 as the second son of Yi Seong-gye (posthumously King Taejo) and his first wife Lady Han, he was a prudent, generous, brave, and able military officer. During the latter days of the declining Goryeo dynasty, Jeongjong followed his father to various battlefronts and fought at his side. When his father took the throne in 1392, he became a prince.
Taejo had two wives — the first one, who gave birth to six sons (including Jeongjong), died before he was crowned; the second wife was Lady Gang, with whom he had two sons. The king favored his youngest son, whose mother was Lady Gang. Chief State Councillor Jeong Do-jeon also backed him as successor, causing much resentment in the other princes.
In 1398, Taejo's fifth son, Yi Bang-won (posthumously King Taejong) led a coup along with many military officers and killed his two younger half-brothers, Jeong Do-jeon, and many of his faction. Yi Bang-won first tried to show that he was not interested in the throne, so he gave a push to Yi Bang-gwa (who was the eldest son by then), to be the next crown prince. King Taejo was upset and abdicated in disgust, and Yi Bang-gwa became Joseon's second ruler. The same year he moved the government back to Gaegyeong, the old Goryeo capital.
In 1400, a conflict broke out between Yi Bang-won and his elder brother, Yi Bang-gan. Yi Bang-won's force attacked and defeated that of his Yi Bang-gan's, who was then sent into exile along with his family. General Park Bo, who persuaded Yi Bang-gan into rebellion, was executed. King Jeongjong, knowing that he was a mere political figurehead for his younger brother, appointed him as crown prince and abdicated months later.
He was an able and wise administrator despite his short reign being marked by bloodshed within the royal family.
Jeongjong died in 1419 and was buried alongside his wife, Queen Jeongan, at Huneung (후릉), in present-day P'anmun District, Kaesŏng, North Hwanghae Province, North Korea.
