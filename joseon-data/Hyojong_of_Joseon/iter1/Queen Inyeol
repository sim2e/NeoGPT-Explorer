Queen Inyeol (Korean: 인열왕후 한씨; Hanja: 仁烈王后 韓氏; 6 August 1594 – 6 January 1636) of the Cheongju Han clan, was a posthumous name bestowed to the wife and first queen consort of Injo of Joseon, the 16th Joseon monarch. She was queen consort of Joseon from 1623 until her death in 1636.

Biography
Lady Han was born on 6 August 1594 into the Cheongju Han clan to Han Jun-gyeom and his wife, Lady Hwang of the Changwon Hwang clan, as their youngest child of five children. Her parents were 5th cousins as they shared Grand Prince Hyoryeong as their 4th great-grandfather.
Her mother later died a few days after her birth, but Lady Han was born and raised in the town of Wonju until she married.
In 1610, she married Prince Neungyang (능양군), Injo of Joseon, when she was 17 and was known as “Princess Consort Cheongseong” (청성군부인, 淸城郡夫人). Princess Cheongseong gave birth to Crown Prince Sohyeon in 1612, Grand Prince Bongrim (later known as King Hyojong) in 1619, and Grand Prince Inpyeong in 1622.
On 24 April 1623, she became the queen consort upon her husband's ascension to the throne. The Queen gave birth to a fourth son, Prince Yongseong, in 1624, her first daughter in 1626, and a fifth son in 1629, but both died prematurely.
On 14 October 1635, she gave birth to a prince, her sixth son, who died later on 22 December 1635. A month later on 6 January 1636, the Queen died at the age of 41 in Changgyeong Palace as she was suffering from postpartum illness.
Her husband, King Injo wanted to bestow Myeongheon (명헌, 明憲) as her posthumous title, but Kim Sang-heon persuaded the king to change the name into Inyeol. “In” (인, 仁) for benevolence and “Yeol” (열, 烈) for pillar.
King Injo had decided to have his own tomb be made next to the queen in Jangneung. After the king died, their son, King Hyojong granted his wish and buried his father there. Jangneung was originally located in Uncheon-ri, Paju, but when snakes and scorpions began to live and infest around the tomb, King Yeongjo moved the tomb to Galhyeon-ri, Paju, Gyeonggi Province.
