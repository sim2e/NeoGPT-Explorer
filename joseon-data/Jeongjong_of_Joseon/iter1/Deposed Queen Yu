Princess Consort Munseong (25 August 1576 – 21 October 1623), of the Munhwa Yu clan, was the wife and queen consort of Yi Hon, King Gwanghae, the 15th Joseon monarch. She was queen consort of Joseon from 1608 until her husband's deposition in 1623, after which she was known as Deposed Queen Yu.

Biography
Early life
The future queen was born on 15 August 1576 during the reign of King Seonjo. Her father, Yu Ja-shin, was member of the Munhwa Yu clan, and her mother, Jeong Yang-jeong, was a member of the Dongrae Jeong clan. Lady Yu was the third daughter and eighth child within six siblings.   
Through her ancestors, her family had some distant relations with the royal family. Through her mother, Lady Yu was a 4th great-granddaughter of King Jeongjong and Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Haengju Ki clan. Through her father, she was also a 5th great-granddaughter of King Jeongjong and Royal Consort Suk-ui of the Chungju Ji clan. Thus making her parents fifth cousins once removed with one another. 
Through her paternal grandmother, her great-great-great-grandfather was Jeong In-ji, and was a first cousin once removed of Queen Inseon, her future niece-in-law and the future Queen Consort of King Hyojong. Through her paternal great-grandmother, Lady Yu was the 4th great-grandniece of Queen Soheon and the 5th great-granddaughter of Sim On.

Marriage, Deposition, and Death
At the age of 11 in 1587, she was selected to become the consort of Yi Hon, Prince Gwanghae, son of Seonjo, born to Kim Gongbin, senior 1st rank king's concubine. As Gwanghae's wife, she was given the royal title of Princess Consort Munseong (문성군부인, Munseong Gunbuin). When Gwanghae became the crown prince in 1592, she was elevated to the crown princess’ rank at the age of 16. 16 years later, Gwanghae ascended to the throne as the fifteenth Joseon king in 1608 and she became queen consort.
The queen's father was given the title Internal Prince Munyang (문양부원군). The queen's mother was given the title Internal Princess Consort Bongwon (봉원부부인).
On April 6, 1623, Gwanghaegun was deposed in a coup by the Westerners faction. The coup directed by Kim Yu took place at night. The King fled but was captured later. His nephew, Injo, was placed on the throne as the 16th Joseon monarch. As deposed king's wife, she lost her status as queen consort and known as Deposed Queen Yu. She was deposed and exiled to Ganghwa Island, together with Gwanghae. Her son, Yi Ji, the deposed Crown Prince, tried to escape with his wife but failed, resulting in them committing suicide. Deposed Queen Yu died on October 21 that the same year after seven months of living in exile.
There was no known tomb for Deposed Queen Yu as she was buried nearby a waste house but her remains could not be found when she was due for a proper burial. But she is “buried” in Jeokseong, Yangju, Gyeonggi Province.
