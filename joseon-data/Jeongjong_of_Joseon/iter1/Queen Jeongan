Queen Jeongan (정안왕후 김씨, 30 January 1355 – 11 August 1412) or Queen Anjeong (안정왕후), of the Gyeongju Kim clan, was a posthumous name bestowed to the wife and queen consort of Yi Gyeong, King Jeongjong; the second monarch of the Korean Joseon Dynasty. She was queen consort of Joseon from 1398 and was honoured as Queen Deok (덕비) until her husband's abdication in 1400 after which she was honoured as Queen Dowager Sundeok (순덕왕대비).

Biography
Early life
Lady Kim was born during King Gongmin of Goyreo’s 4th year of reign on 30 January 1355 into the Gyeongju Kim clan as the eldest daughter of Kim Cheon-seo and Lady Lee of the Damyang Lee clan. Lady Kim had two older brothers and five younger siblings. 
Lady Kim is descended from the Silla Dynasty’s Gyeongju Kim clan. During the reign of King Shinjong of Goryeo, her grandfather, Kim Bong-mo (김봉모, 金鳳毛; ? - 1209), served as Pyeongjangsa (평장사, 平章事) and received the posthumous title of Jeongpyeong (정평, 靖平). He later established the Pyeongjangsa Branch (평장사공파) of the clan. 
Through her great-great-grandmother, Lady Kim was a fourth cousin twice removed of Queen Wongyeong as they shared Min Yeong-mo as their ancestor, and would eventually become her sister-in-law through marriage. 
It is unknown what year she married Yi Bang-gwa, the second son of Yi Seong-gye and Lady Han.

Royal life
In 1398, at the age of 42-43, she became Crown Princess Consort Deok when her husband, Prince Yeongan (the future King Jeongjong), became Crown Prince. Her father was given the royal title of “Internal Prince Wolseong, Kim Cheon-seo” (월성부원군 김천서, 月城府院君 金天瑞), and her mother was given the royal title of “Internal Princess Consort Samhanguk of the Damyang Lee clan” (삼한국대부인 담양 이씨, 三韓國大夫人 潭陽 李氏).
She was then referred as “Queen Consort Deok" (덕비; Deokbi meaning Virtuous Consort) from the 5 September 1398 until her husband’s abdication.
In the aftermath of the Second Strife of Princes when her husband abdicated in favor of his younger brother, Yi Bang-won, Prince Jeongan on 28 November 1400, along with him being bestowed the courtesy title of "King Emeritus Inmungongye" (인문공예상왕), she was bestowed the courtesy title of "Queen Dowager Sundeok" (순덕왕대비, Sundeok-Wangdaebi) by her royal brother-in-law.

Death and posthumous title
Queen Deok later died on 11 August 1412 during her brother-in-law’s, King Taejong, reign. Her husband outlived her by seven years and both are buried within Hureung in Yeongjeong-ri, Kaepung County, North Hwanghae Province, North Korea. She had no issue with King Jeongjong.
She was given the posthumous title of Queen Jeongan (정안왕후, 定安王后) after her death, but was also given another lesser-known posthumous title "Queen Anjeong" (안정왕후, 安定王后) during King Yeonsan’s 10th year of reign and King Gwanghae’s 1st year of reign.
In 1681, 270 years after her death, King Sukjong added Onmyeongjangui (온명장의, 溫明莊懿) to her posthumous title.
