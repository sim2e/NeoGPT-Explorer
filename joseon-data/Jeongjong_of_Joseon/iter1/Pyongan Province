Pyongan Province (Korean: 평안도; Hanja: 平安道; IPA: [pʰjʌŋando]) was one of Eight Provinces of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Pyongan was located in the northwest of Korea. The provincial capital was Pyeongyang (now Pyongyang, North Korea).

History
Pyeong'an Province was formed in 1413. Its name derived from the names of two of its principal cities, Pyeongyang (Korean: 평양; Hanja: 平壤) and Anju (Korean: 안주; Hanja: 安州).
In 1895, the province was replaced by the Districts of Ganggye (Korean: 강계부; Hanja: 江界府) in the northeast, Uiju County (Korean: 의주부; Hanja: 義州府) in the northwest, and Pyeongyang (Korean: 평양부; Hanja: 平壤府) in the south.
In 1896, Kanggye and Ŭiju Districts were reorganized into North Pyongan Province, and Pyeongyang District was reorganized as South Pyongan Province. North and South Pyongan Provinces are part of North Korea.

Geography
Pyeong'an was bounded on the east by Hamgyeong Province, on the south by Hwanghae Province, on the west by the Yellow Sea, and on the north by Qing China.
The regional name for the province was Gwanseo.
