Grand Prince Yangnyeong (Hangul: 양녕대군, Hanja: 讓寧大君; 1394 – 8 October 1462) was the former Crown Prince of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. He was the first son of King Taejong and his wife, Queen Wongyeong. Yangnyeong was the elder brother of Sejong the Great, and an ancestor of Syngman Rhee, an independence activist and the first President of South Korea.

Biography
He was born as Yi Je (Hangul: 이제, Hanja: 李禔) in 1394. Originally his father appointed him as the Crown Prince but he eventually executed Queen Wongyeong's brothers and in the 18th year of his reign replaced prince Yangnyeong with his third son prince Chungnyeong as his successor. Known for his literature and calligraphy skills, the former Crown Prince lacked in the requisite skills for kingship and acted extremely rude in court. On May 1415, he caused a scandal when he had an affair with Chogungjang, the kisaeng of his uncle and former king, Jeongjong. Yangnyeong was unaware that Chogungjang was his uncle's woman. On 15 February 1417, Yangnyeong secretly brought in Eori, the concubine of Gwak Seon, into the palace. She later became pregnant with the crown prince's child. Due to Yangnyeong's behavior, King Taejong dethroned Crown Prince Yangnyeong from the role of the crown prince on 3 June 1418. Grand Prince Hyoryeong, Yangnyeong's second brother, had similar feelings about Chungyeong being king, and so he became a monk in a Buddhist temple. It is possible that King Taejong’s willingness to execute troublesome family members helped to encourage his first two sons to step aside, allowing King Taejong's third and favorite son to become King Sejong. This plot ultimately brought Sejong to the throne. Later, Yangnyeong became a wandering traveler and lived in the mountains.After Sejong had taken the throne, the relationship between the brothers became strong, and Sejong often invited Yangnyeong to the palace.
Yangnyeong lived as a wanderer and died in 1462, almost living for 68 years.The tomb of Prince Yangneong was reopened in 2018 to the public after 18 years of closure.
