Prince Sanggye or Crown Prince Wanpung (January 21, 1769 - November 20, 1786) was a Korean prince, an adopted son of Jeongjo of Joseon and biological child of Prince Euneon. His first name was Yi Jun (이준 李濬), his changed name was Yi Dam (이담 李湛),  and his other name was Yi Shik (이식 李湜). His posthumous epithet is unknown.

Life
Prince Sanggye was born as Yi Jun, on January 21, 1769, in Hanseong. He was the son of Prince Euneon and his wife, Princess Consort Sangsan of the Jincheon Song clan, a daughter of Song Rak-hyu. His father was the son of Crown Prince Sado and his great-grandfather was Yeongjo of Joseon. During his early childhood, he was adopted by Hong Guk-yeong, the fourth cousin-once-removed of Lady Hyegyeong, as the son of his sister, Royal Noble Consort Won of the Pungsan Hong clan, and King Jeongjo.
At the time, Ku Seon-bok and other Joseon noblemen supported Yi Jun as heir to the throne, but as King Jeongjo was in his mid-20s and could still be expected to produce a child, Kim Jong-su, along with many of Jeongjo's ministers, who were enemies of Hong Guk-yeong, demanded his and Crown Prince Wanpung's removal.
On May 7, 1779, Lady Hong Won-bin of Pungsan suddenly died and the King's ministers repeatedly accused Hong Guk-yeong and the Crown Prince.
On September 26, 1779, Hong Guk-yeong was expelled from power and jailed. Crown Prince Wanpung was dethroned and removed from the peerage. His title was changed from Wanpung to Sanggye and his name was also changed from Yi Jun to Yi Dam, but the King's retainers continued their attacks.
On January 21, 1784, he was married to Lady Shin of Pyeongsan, a daughter of Shin Oh.On November 20, 1786, Prince Sanggye suddenly died and it's suspected to have been poisoned. Some accused Hong Guk-yeong or his biological father, Prince Euneon, and others accused some of King Jeongjo's retainers. After his death, he was buried at Yeonhul Castle, near modern Sinchon Station and Yonsei University. His funeral was personally arranged by his adoptive father, Jeongjo of Joseon.
Prince Sanggye was not reinstated for many years. In 1801, his mother, Princess Consort Sangsan, and his wife, Princess Consort Shin, were executed for their belief in Catholicism (Neo-Confucianism was the state religion of the Joseon Dynasty).
He was eventually amnestied and rehabilitated on June 17, 1849, by King Cheoljong, who was his half-nephew.
