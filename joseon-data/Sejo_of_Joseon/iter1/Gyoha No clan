The Gyoha No clan (Korean: 교하 노씨; Hanja: 交河 盧氏) is a Korean clan. Its bon-gwan is Paju, Gyeonggi Province. According to census research in 2015, the number of Gyoha No clan members was 61,747. The clan's founder is No O, the 2nd son of No Hae, who hailed from T'ang China. No O was dispatched to Silla as a scholar at the Hanlin Academy in T'ang China. However, claims associating the clan's origins with Chinese immigrants are strongly attested due to their failed validation. According to the Shijok Wonryu, today's Gyoha Noh clan substantially descends from No Chaek, husband to Royal Lady Gyeonghye, the granddaughter of Wonjong of Goryeo.
