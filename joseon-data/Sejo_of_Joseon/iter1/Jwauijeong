The Jwauijeong [tɕwa ɰi tɕʌŋ] was the Second State Councillor of the Uijeongbu (State Council), subordinate in rank only to the Yeonguijeong, during the Joseon dynasty of Korea (1392–1910). Only one official was appointed to the position and was variously referred to as Jwasang, Jwajeongseung, Jwagyu, Jwahap, or Jwadae.Since its foundation, the Joseon dynasty, which had succeeded to the state apparatus of the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392), had been adjusting its government organization. In 1400, the second year after King Jeongjong came to the throne, he renamed the Dopyeong Assembly (都評議事司), the highest organ in charge of the state affairs of Goryeo, to Uijeongbu and created the post of Jwauijeong along with that of Uuijeong (Third State Councillor) and Yeonguijeong (Chief State Councillor). The three officials were collectively referred to as the Samjeongseung ('three top officials') or the Samuijeong ('three high councillors').
