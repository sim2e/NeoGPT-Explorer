Wang Ryung (died May 897), also known as Wang Yung, was a Korean hojok, or local regional lord of Song-ak, who lived during the Later Three Kingdoms period. He was the father of Wang Kon, the founder of the Goryeo dynasty. He was later posthumously honoured with a temple name of Sejo and a posthumous name of King Wimu the Great by his descendants. 
In 896, he surrendered to forces of Korean warlord Kung Ye, in exchange for the recognition of Wang's son, Geon, as the castle lord of Song-ak. Kung Ye appointed him as the prefect of Geumseong. He died there a year later. 
After he died at Geumseong County in 897, he was buried in a cave along the river in Yeonganseong, which later named and known as Changneung tomb (창릉, 昌陵). On 11 March 1217, it was moved to Bongeun Temple (봉은사) and in 1243, it was moved again to Gaegol-dong in Ganghwa. In 1027 (18th years reign of Hyeonjong of Goryeo), he was given a Posthumous name of Won-ryeol(yeol) (원렬(열), 元烈) and in 1235 (40th years reign of Gojong of Goryeo), he was given again the name of Min-hye (민혜, 敏惠).
