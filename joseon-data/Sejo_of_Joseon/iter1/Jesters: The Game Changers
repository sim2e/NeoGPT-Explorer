Conversely, Asian Movie Pulse stated that it was "a respectful ode to the storytellers and the magic of storytelling as a medium of entertainment as well as propaganda, a good-looking production overall which has way more merits than demerits."The Chosun praised the acting of Son Hyun-joo, Park Hee-soon, and Cho Jin-woong while criticizing Yoon Park's acting as awkward.
