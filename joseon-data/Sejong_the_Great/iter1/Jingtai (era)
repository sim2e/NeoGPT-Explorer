Jingtai (Chinese: 景泰; pinyin: Jǐngtài; Wade–Giles: Ching-t'ai; lit. 'exalted view'; 14 January 1450 – 14 February 1457) was the era name (nianhao) of the Jingtai Emperor (reigned 1449–1457), the seventh emperor of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). It was used for a total of seven years. On 11 February 1457 (Jingtai 8, 17th day of the 1st month), taking advantage of the opportunity that the Jingtai Emperor was seriously ill and unable to come to court, Emperor Yingzong launched the "Duomen Coup" (奪門之變, "Storming of the Gates Incident") and restored his imperial throne. On 15 February of the same year (21st day of the 1st month), Emperor Yingzong changed the era to Tianshun.
