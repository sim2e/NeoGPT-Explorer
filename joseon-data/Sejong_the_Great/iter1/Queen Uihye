Queen Uihye of the Yeongheung Choe clan (Korean: 의혜왕후 최씨; Hanja: 懿惠王后 崔氏) was the wife of Yi Jachun and mother of Yi Seonggye, Joseon dynasty's founder. She was posthumously honoured as Ui-Bi (의비, 懿妃; "the virtuous queen") at first.

Biography
Early life
The future Queen Uihye was born into the Yeongheung Choe clan as the daughter of the Korean chiliarch of the Yuan dynasty called Choe Han-gi, the Duke Jeonghyo and Internal Prince Yeongheung (영흥부원군 정효공 최한기, 永興府院君 靖孝公 崔閑奇) and Grand Lady Yi of Joseon State (조선국대부인 이씨, 朝鮮國大夫人 李氏). Her family name, along with that of her father Jo-Jo's (Korean: 조조; Hanja: 趙祚), was originally from the Jo clan.
But once her father was named a Korean chiliarch of the Yuan dynasty, he changed his name to Choe Han-gi (Korean: 최한기; Hanja: 崔閑奇). Her family long resided ever since in today's Anbyon County, Gangwon Province in North Korea, which was once called Deungju (Korean: 등주; Hanja: 登州) during the Goryeo dynasty. Having become very wealthy by saving a lot of money, her family were known to be rich amongst the local population.

Youth life
It was said that from young, Lady Choe was intelligent and had many unusual things. When her parents reached the age of poverty, they wanted her to married Kim-Rin (김린, 金麟)'s son, but when she did not listen, they offered to divide the household goods in half. Knowing this, Choe cried sadly and said, "How can someone unexpectedly marry Kim-Rin's son when they are born into this world and have a great relationship?, a matchmaker will come soon.” (사람이 세상에 태어나서 큰 인연이 있는데 어찌 뜻밖에 김린의 아들에게 시집갈 수 있겠는가. 배필이 곧 이를 것이다).

Marriage with Yi Jachun and death
Then, Yi Jachun went to Choe Han-gi's house on business, when she had a good dream that two dragons came down from the sky, one went into her stomach and the other stood in the yard. Since they meet each other in there, Yi then proposed Lady Choe and they were married. During her lifetime after married, Lady Choe more commonly called as Grand Lady of Three Han State (삼한국대부인, 三韓國大夫人). She then bore Yi 1 son (Yi Seong-gye) and 1 daughter (Princess Jeonghwa). However, she died before Joseon dynasty established.

Later life
After Yi Seong-gye made the new Joseon dynasty, she then elevated her rank into Consort Ui (의비, 懿妃) by him as her Posthumous name. In the following year, by her grandson, King Yi Bang-won's order, she was Posthumously honoured as Queen Consort Uihye (의혜왕후, 懿惠王后).

Tomb and funeral
The Queen was buried in Hwareung Tomb (화릉, 和陵), Dongheung-ri, Hamheung-si, Hamgyeongnam-do, adjacent from her husband in Jeongneung Tomb.
In 1471 (2nd year reign of Seongjong of Joseon), her funeral was held in Yeongnyeong Hall (영녕전, 永寧殿) and in 1795 (19th year reign of Jeongjo of Joseon), her veneration was held again in Yeongheung Palace (영흥본궁, 永興本宮).
