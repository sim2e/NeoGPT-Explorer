Services
Standard Korean Language Dictionary
On January 1, 1992, it began work on compiling the Standard Korean Language Dictionary (SKLD). It published the dictionary on October 11, 1999 in three volumes. It published a revised and online version on October 8, 2008.

Korean-Foreign Language Learners' Dictionary
The NIKL maintains a number of online foreign language dictionaries for a variety of languages, including English, Russian, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Indonesian.

Urimalsaem
Urimalsaem (우리말샘) is an online, open source, and collaborative dictionary that users can edit in a manner similar to how Wikipedia operates, albeit with individual edits reviewed by experts. It was launched on October 5, 2016, with an initial set of 1,109,722 headwords.

Datasets
The NIKL maintains several datasets for use in research, one of which consists of 3,515,010 news articles in Korean from 2009 to 2018. The dataset has been used in a number of papers on natural language processing and machine learning, and have even had derivative datasets created based on them. In 2015, shortly before the 2016 Korean Sign Language Act, the NIKL began collecting a dataset for Korean Sign Language called the KSL Corpus Project. In 2022, it announced that it had collected 180 hours of language material from 148 deaf people at five locations, and was continuing to collect more.

History
The NIKL was originally founded at a non-governmental level as the Academy of the Korean Language (국어연구소) on May 1, 1984. It was established as a subsidiary of the Korean Ministry of Culture on January 23, 1991 under the name National Academy of the Korean Language (국립국어연구원). It took its original name again on November 11, 2005, and again changed its name to its current form in October 2015.On January 18, 2022, the NIKL announced several new initiatives:
It would create a Korean language proficiency diagnosis system that leveraged assistance from artificial intelligence. The NIKL's director stated that "If we can implement an evaluation system worked on by 80 percent humans, and 20 percent with the help of AI, it can further increase efficiency. This makes it possible to conduct writing tests on a larger scale". The test is to be developed over five years, from 2023 to 2027, with a budget of ₩10 billion won ($8.39 million). The test aims to improve domestic writing skills and to be used on college entrance exams.
It would make significant revisions to their dictionary, after it found that the 1999 Standard Korean Language Dictionary failed to keep up to major changes during the digital era. This project is expected to last between 2022 and 2026.
To meet increasing demand and quality expectations for Korean language teachers outside of the peninsula, it would create a course and certification program for teachers.
