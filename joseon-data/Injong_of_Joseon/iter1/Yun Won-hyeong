Yun Won-hyeong (Korean: 윤원형, 尹元衡; 1503 – 18 November 1565) was a Korean political figure of the Joseon period. He was the younger brother of Queen Munjeong, the 3rd wife of 11th King Jungjong and was the maternal uncle of the 13th King Myeongjong.
He was Chief State Councillor from 1563 to 1565. His courtesy name was Eonpyung (언평; 彦平). In 1565, after the death of Queen Munjeong, both Yoon Won-hyeong and his wife  Jeong Nan-jeong were exiled from the capital. Unable to make a political comeback, both committed suicide by poison.

Life
In 1503, Yun Won-hyeong was born as the fifth son of Yun Ji-im, father of Queen Munjung and third cousin of Queen Janggyeong and Yun Im. He was also the great-great-grandnephew of Queen Jeonghui, who was the wife of Joseon Dynasty's 7th King Sejo of Joseon.
Yun Won-hyeong was a political figure from an aristocratic family and a maternal relation of the royal family of the Joseon Dynasty. His family was of the Papyeong Yun clan (Hangul: 파평윤씨, Hanja: 波平尹氏). His elder sister, Lady Yun, was a concubine to King Jungjong of Joseon, and his niece Lady Yun was a concubine to King Injong. In March 1515, Jungjong's second wife Queen Janggyeong died and Jungjong formally married Yun Won-hyeong's older sister Lady Yun to be the new Queen Consort. Their son was Grand Prince Gyeongwon (the future King Myeongjong).
In 1533, Yun Won-hyeong passed the national examinations, and was appointed to the literature department of Byeol to become an officer. While pursuing an officer position, Yun also sought to make his nephew, Grand Prince Gyeongwon, the next king of Joseon. Yun was temporarily exiled for his actions but came back in 1544. He ran into some conflicts with two relatives who were officials: Yun Im and Kim Ahn-ro. This made for a difficult situation, since Kim Ahn-ro's granddaughter (the daughter of Princess Hyohye and his son, Kim Hui) had married Yun Won-hyeong's own nephew, Yun Baek-won. Also, Yun Im was the maternal uncle of Injong and the older brother of Queen Janggyeong.
In 1543, King Jungjong died. In 1545, King Injong died. Yun Won-hyeong killed his opponents and relatives that supported his third cousin, among these being Yun Im. Later, his brother Yun Won-ro was killed (the Eulsa massacre). In 1546, he controlled political powers.
In 1547 he became Minister of Personnel (Ijo Panseo), in 1551 Left State Councillor, and in 1563 Chief State Councillor.
When Queen Munjeong died in 1565, he lost all political power. This caused he and his second wife, Jeong Nan-Jeong to commit suicide.
