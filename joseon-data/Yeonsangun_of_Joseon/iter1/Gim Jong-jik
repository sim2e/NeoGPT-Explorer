Kim Jong-jik (Korean: 김종직; June 1431 – 19 August 1492), often known by his art name Jeompiljae (Korean: 점필재), was a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar in the early Joseon dynasty. He was born in Miryang in Gyeongsang Province, to a yangban family of the Seonsan Gim clan. He passed the jinsa literary licentiate examination in 1453 and the higher examination in 1459.
After passing the examination, Gim entered government service, holding a wide range of positions. He earned the special favor of King Seongjong, as well as the enmity of the Hungu (Loyal Retainers) faction.
After his death, Gim Jong-jik's writings became the basis for the First literati purge of 1498 under the rule of Yeonsangun. His students included Gim Il-son who was killed in the first literati purge, and Gim Goeng-pil, who was killed in the subsequent Second literati purge of 1504 along with many others. Gim Jong-jik's memory was later rehabilitated, and he was enshrined in various seowon including Yerim Seowon in Miryang and Geumo Seowon in Gumi.
