Biography
Early life
On 24 October 1491, the Princess was born when her father, Prince Yeonsan, and her mother, Princess Consort Geochang, were still the heir successor to the throne as Crown Prince and Crown Princess Consort. The Princess was eventually named Yi Su-Eok (Hangul: 이수억, Hanja: 李壽億). Through her mother, the Princess is a cousin of Queen Dangyeong and is a cousin-in-law of Princess Gyeongsun; the daughter of King Seongjong. She eventually became the great-grand aunt of Queen Inheon through her brother-in-law, Gu Hui-Gyeong (구희경, 具希璟), and his wife, Lady Sin of the Geochang Sin clan (거창 신씨, 居昌 愼氏); who was her and Queen Dangyeong’s younger cousin.
Princess Hwisin was the only child within her siblings to have survived to adulthood.

Marriage
The Princess was arranged to marry with Gu Su-Yeong's son, Gu Mun-Gyeong, who was then given the title of Lord Neungyang (능양위) and had one son named Gu Eom in 1512. Gu Su-Yeong was the son-in-law of Grand Prince Yeongeung, the eight son of Sejong of Joseon and Queen Soheon of the Cheongsong Sim clan.
The Princess's maternal grandmother was Princess Jungmo, the first daughter of Grand Prince Imyeong with Grand Princess Consort Jean of the Jeonju Choi clan. The Princess's mother-in-law was Princess Gilan who was the daughter of Grand Prince Yeongeung; both Grand Prince Imyeong and Grand Prince Yeongeung were the sons of King Sejong and Queen Soheon and became her great-grandfathers. Princess Gilan was also a maternal cousin of Queen Jeongsun.

Yeonsangun’s Abdication
However, after the Princess's father’s abdication, Princess Hwisin’s younger brothers died by poisoning, and her home was confiscated and divided among Park Won-Jong, Yoo Soon-jeong, and Sung Hui-an. But 2 years later in 1508, with the opinions of Yun Sun (유순, 柳洵) and other officials, the new King, Jungjong of Joseon, reunited the Princess and her husband. The king later visited her and her family as well as giving back her house.

Death
When the Princess and her husband died, their direct descendants were cut off, and Yi Ahn-nul, the only adoptive grandson of their son Gu Eom, became a servant and served the ancestral rites for his grandparents and great-grandparents.
