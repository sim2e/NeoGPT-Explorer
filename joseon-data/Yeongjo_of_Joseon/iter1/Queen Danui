Queen Danui (단의왕후, 端懿王后, 11 July 1686 – 8 March 1718), of the Cheongsong Sim clan, was the first wife and princess consort of Crown Prince Hwiso, the future Gyeongjong of Joseon. She died before her husband's ascension to the throne.

Biography
The future Queen Danui was born on 11 July 1686 from the Cheongsong Sim clan as the eldest child and daughter of Sim Ho and his wife, Lady Park of the Goryeong Park clan.  
Through her father, Lady Sim is the 4th great-grandniece of Queen Insun, the wife of King Myeongjong, and the 9th great-grandniece of Queen Soheon, the wife of King Sejong and daughter of Sim On. She is also the 5th great-grandniece of Yi Ryang, a descendant of Grand Prince Hyoryeong, the son of King Taejong and Queen Wongyeong. 
She was appointed as a Crown Princess (세자빈) when she married Crown Prince Yi Yun in 1696 at the age of 11.
She died on 8 March 1718, during the 44th year of Sukjong of Joseon's reign, two years before Crown Prince Yi Yun ascend the throne as Gyeongjong of Joseon. After Gyeongjong's sudden death, her younger brother Shim Yu-hyeon (심유현, 沈維賢) claimed that Gyeongjong was confined by Noron eunuchs and was then poisoned. 
She was later posthumously named Queen Danui (단의왕후,端懿王后); adding Gonghyojeongmok (공효정목, 恭孝定穆) to her posthumous title when her husband became king. Her tomb is located on Hyereung 197, Donggureung-ro, Guri-si, Gyeonggi-do.
