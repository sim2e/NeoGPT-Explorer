Ilseongnok (Korean: 일성록), known as The Records of Daily Reflections or Diary of Self-examination in English, is a daily record of court events. The extant records cover the last 150 years of the Joseon dynasty, from 1760 (the 36th year of the reign of King Yeongjo) to the end of the Joseon dynasty in 1910.
The records are intended for use by the monarch of Joseon. Ilseongnok began as King Jeongjo's personal diary for self-reflection on his personal and academic affairs since his youth, but was transformed into an official daily journal of state affairs in 1785. The journal was maintained with the help of officials from Kyujanggak, the royal library.On December 31, 1973, it was designated as the 153rd national treasure of Korea. In May 2011, it was listed in UNESCO's Memory of the World registry. The Ilseongnok is a vital historical record, and along with the Joseon Wangjo Sillok, the Seungjeongwon ilgi, and the Bibyeonsa Teungrok, constitutes one of the primary historical sources for the study of the period.

Comparison to the Veritable Records
The Veritable Records may not have been as helpful to monarchs because they were not permitted to read it without supervision. In addition, the Records were based on the position of the editor and the ruling party in the process of restructuring based on Sacho (사초).By contrast, the Ilseongnok could be freely viewed by monarchs, and offers more details of the daily tasks of administration.
