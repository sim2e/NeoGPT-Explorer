Prince Yeongpyeong (Hangul: 영평군, Hanja: 永平君; 30 August 1828 – 1 February 1902), personal name Yi Gyeong-eung (Hangul: 이경응; Hanja: 李景應), was a member of the Royal Jeonju Yi clan, as the second son of Grand Internal Prince Jeongye, and the second eldest half-brother of Cheoljong of Joseon. He was the last surviving great-great-grandson of Yeongjo of Joseon.

Biography
The future Prince Yeongpyeong was born on August 20, 1828 (on the 20th day of the 7th month in Lunar calendar), as the second son of Yi Gwang (Jeongye Daewongun), by one of his concubines, Lady Yi. He was born as Yi Won-hui (Hangul: 이원희; Hanja: 李元羲) and a commoner.
In 1844, because of Min Jin-yong's plot, he was exiled to Ganghwa Island along with his younger half-brother (the future King Cheoljong of Joseon).After Cheoljong ascended to the throne in 1849, Yi Won-hui was renamed Yi Uk (이욱; 李昱) and received the royal title, Prince Yeongpyeong. Throughout the reign of Cheoljong, Prince Yeongpyeong remained childless despite marrying twice.King Cheoljong died in 1864 and was succeeded by King Gojong. In that same year, Yi Sun-dal (later renamed Yi Jae-sun) was chosen to be the heir of Prince Yeongpyeong, who was a key member of Jeongye Daewongun's family, but suffered from a chronic disease and had no male heir. In 1868, there was an order requiring all descendants of Deokheung Daewongun (whose son ascended to the throne in 1567, known as Seonjo of Joseon), one of the closest relatives to the Royal Family, to rename, based on a unified sequence of generation name used in the said cadet branch; therefore, Prince Yeongpyeong was renamed again to Yi Gyeong-eung (이경응; 李景應).He also hosted two royal weddings: firstly, for Princess Yeonghye (his niece, daughter of Cheoljong), in 1872, and secondly, for Yi Kang, Prince Uihwa (5th son of Gojong), in 1893.Yi Jae-sun, Prince Yeongpyeong's adopted son, was childless as well, so he adopted Yi Han-yong (a descendant of Crown Prince Sohyeon) as his heir, but the later died young, in 1890.
In 1897, Prince Yeongpyeong chose a distant relative, Yi In-bong (later renamed Yi Hae-seung) to be the heir to his late grandson; the request was approved by Gojong, who declared himself to be the Emperor of the Korean Empire in the same year. Due to the frequent adoptions within the clan, Yi Hae-seung was by birth registered as a descendant of Deokheung Daewongun, but his actual ancestry could be traced back to Grand Prince Wolsan, making him a 13th cousin three times removed to Prince Yeongpyeong.In 1899, as Crown Prince Sado was elevated to "Emperor Jangjo", Yi Jae-sun received the royal title "Prince Cheongan".Prince Yeongpyeong died on February 1, 1902, age 73. Prince Cheongan died in 1904, and Yi Hae-seung received the title "Prince Cheongpung" in 1910.
