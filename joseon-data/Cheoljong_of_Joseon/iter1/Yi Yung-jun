Yi Yung-jun (Korean: 이융준; Hanja: 李隆俊; 22 November 1858 – 25 May 1859) was an heir presumptive of Joseon (wonja, 원자, 元子) as the only son of Yi Byeon, King Cheoljong and Queen Cheorin. From birth he became a Wonja and unlike his half-brothers, he seemed to have grown well without any illnesses, but died suddenly due to a fever on 25 May, 1859, at six months of age. The next day, the King announced his young son's death and ordered his soldiers to accompany him when holding the young prince's funeral.
