Sunjo of Joseon (29 July 1790 – 13 December 1834, reigned 1800–1834) was the 23rd king of the Korean Joseon Dynasty. Sunjo was the 2nd son of King Jeongjo with Royal Noble Consort Su, one of King Jeongjo's concubines.

Biography
He was born with the title of His Royal Highness Prince Yi Gong on 29 July 1790 (18 June 1790 in lunar calendar). Upon the death of his father, King Jeongjo, Yi Gong ascended to the throne at age 10 on 4 July 1800, lunar calendar.
In 1802, aged 13, King Sunjo married Lady Kim, known posthumously as Queen Sunwon, daughter of Kim Jo-sun, who was a leader of the Andong Kim clan.
Since he ascended the throne at a young age, Queen Dowager Jeongsun, the second queen of King Yeongjo, ruled as queen regent, which allowed her to wield power over state affairs. Despite King Sunjo's efforts to reform politics, the fundamental principles of government deteriorated. The state examination became disordered and corruption in the government personnel administration prevailed. This resulted in disorder in society and various riots broke out among the people, including the revolt by Hong Gyeong-nae in 1811–1812. The Ogajaktongbeop (五家作統法), a census registration system to group five houses as one unit, was carried out in this period, and oppression against Roman Catholicism began in earnest.
In 1811 the last diplomatic envoys were sent by Korea to Japan. Based on records of that trip, a reconstruction of the diplomatic vessel has been made for the National Maritime Museum of Korea.
King Sunjo died after reigning for 35 years in 1834 at the age of 44. He was first buried next to Jangneung, Paju, the tomb of King Injo and Queen Inryeol but later moved to Illeung, Seoul as the Feng Shui at the old site was deemed to be unfavourable.
