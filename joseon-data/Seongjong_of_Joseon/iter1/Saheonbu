Saheonbu (Korean: 사헌부; Hanja: 司憲府, lit. 'Office of the Inspector-General') administered inspections during Goryeo and Joseon dynasty in Korea. This branch of government inspected Hanyang, the capital, and periphery. It was also responsible for licensing officials, impeachment and legal inquiries, which also extended to the control of King's relatives. An important duty was to remonstrate with the king.Since this office had  judicial responsibility for officials and the subjects, the ethos was strict.

History
The board of inspection (as a governmental instrument) actually began several centuries earlier. During Silla dynasty, the title was converted to Saganwon during the reign of Gongmin of Goryeo (reigned 1351 - 1374).
Taejo of Joseon established the office immediately following the foundation of Joseon Dynasty in 1392. The standard organization was one head officer and 12 officials with about 40 other bureaucrats.

Administration of Gwageo (civil service exams)The system began in China, where the office played a wider role at the royal court. In this sense, the office and its responsibility was in line with Saganwon where the subjects remonstrate the order of King.
The issue of royal court was to control over the power between the king and the subjects, keeping abreast of the order of the government, which later produced severe side effects in some cases. Its work was somewhat similar to the board of audits and inspection in current time.
