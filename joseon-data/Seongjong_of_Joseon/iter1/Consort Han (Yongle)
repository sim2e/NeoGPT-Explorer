Biography
Joseon sent a total of 114 women as tribute to the Ming dynasty, consisting of 16 virgin girls including Lady Han who was chosen as an imperial concubine of the Yongle Emperor because of her outstanding beauty.In 1421, she was implicated in the alleged plot which resulted in the mass execution in the emperor's harem, where many of the emperor's concubines, their maids and eunuchs were executed, accused of having participated in a murder plot against the emperor. 
She managed to avoid being executed but was imprisoned. When the emperor died in 1424, she belonged to the 30 people executed in order to join the emperor by being buried with him.After the Hongxi Emperor ascended, Consort Li knelt down and begged the new emperor to let her return to Joseon to support her elderly mother but the Hongxi Emperor didn't allow her and ordered to have Consort Li hanged and buried with the late emperor. Consort Li was posthumously granted the title of Consort Kanghuizhuangshuli.
