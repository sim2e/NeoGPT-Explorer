Biography
On December 21, 1671 (12th year of her father's reign), Yi On-hui was honoured as Princess Myeongan (명안공주, 明安公主).
In 1679 (5th year of Sukjong's reign), she married Oh Tae-ju (오태주), a son of Oh Du-in (오두인), who was a key figure of the Seoin faction. Her husband was honoured as Prince Consort Haechang (해창위, 海昌慰) and their formal wedding ceremony was held on December 18, 1680.The drought being severe at that time, Song Si-yeol (송시열) and others filed an appeal requesting that the Princess's residence be built in a modest way to reduce the size and cost.
One year later, after the Princess's in-laws illegally occupied the mounds and fields in Deoksan, Chungcheong Province, a lawsuit broke out and the King ordered them to return the land.
Princess Myeongan died on June 25, 1687, five days from her birthday at the age of 21 years old, and is buried in Sasa-dong, Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea.
